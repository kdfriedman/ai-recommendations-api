It's a mixed-currency setup, which is the opposite of simplifying. Don't get me wrong, I am a fan of mixed-currency, but it's a lot more complicated than cashback or sticking to one award currency.",

Can someone correct me if I’m wrong?\n\n\n\n**this is assuming the Disney+ credit has no value to you. just using the pure rewards rates of the cards",

Though, it is not possible to entirely offset the annual fee with permanent credits. \n\n**If you don't care about lounge access:**\n\nCiti Premier: This card does a lot for you, earning points in 3x points on the all of the main categorical spending.

I prefer the Hilton one due to their hotels and Diamond status for holding the card compared to the Marriott. I highly recommend looking into a Schwab Checking (see their debit card HUGE) and Brokerage account and from there considering the Schwab AMEX Plat to redeem MR points into your brokerage account. I’d also take a look at the Delta Reserve from AMEX. I read that Delta is a frequent government airline so it makes sense to have that in your wallet if that is the case. Below link has the AMEX application rules to be aware of. The Capital One Savor card might be worth a look. I’d strongly recommend the Blue Cash Preferred for supermarkets and gas. You can buy gift cards at the supermarket to extract more value from the 6% at supermarkets. Side note, AMEX customer service is top notch; so good for disputes and anything else from my xp. Continuing your business with them isn’t a bad thing with that in mind. Those are a few that come to mind.

That way you can double the credits and cash out points easily.   If you have a plus 1, the delta cards give you free checked bags and a companion pass.  The Hilton aspire and Marriott brilliant also have a lot of benefits.  You can use the Marriott card to help achieve lifetime status with them.",

Then you can 'ignore' the fee, because the benefit *should* almost always outweigh the fee. My problem with this is many lenders won't let you get the SUB again or make you wait a long time before getting it again. \n\n~~My suggestion would be Venmo - unlimited 3% in your top category~~\n\nI can't guarantee any of these but:\n\n* Altitude Reserve if it can be a mobile payment is 3%, plus more of you use their travel portal \n* ~~BoA customized Cash is 3% if it counts as an online payment (or more if you have some fancy elite status with BoA)~~\n* PayPal is 3% on PayPal purchases\n\nThere are also transfer partners, but they aren't straightforward pricing and you can get worse value if you do it incorrectly)\n\nTL;DR:\n~~1. Venmo~~\n1. Churn/ SUB\n1. Cash\n1. You could try the others but they seem flimsy\n\nEdited: I debated deleting the whole post, since many things were disproved. Didn't realize there still were categories for some cards. Some of the other suggestions like SUB may still work.",

                "commentText": "Hmm...so with a convenience fee of 2.75% right off the bat, I really only see only a few ways really where you could come out ahead, but its still very much possible:\n\n1) By churning business cards through you husband's LLC like suggested. Some cards to consider depending on how much tuition ends up being. If your son's tuition is very high consider the Capital One Spark Business Cash Plus ( which is the only capital one business card that does not report and does not count to 5/24) but gives you $500 for $5,000 in 6 months and another $500 for $50,000 in 12 months. If tuition is not that high then try seeing if you are targeted for the AMEX blue business cash card offering $750 if you spend $15,000 in 12 months. Lastly sticking to business cards, you could get any Chase Ink card of your choice of $750 for $7,500 in 3 months and the U.S. Bank Leverage card offering $750 for $7,500 in 4 months. You could get two Chase Ink business cards too, but you may have to wait three months in between to maximize chances that both cards get approved. You also have Capital on Tap by the points guy offering an equivalent. See point 3 as well for additional savings.\n\n2) By churning a mix of personal cards. In which case I suggest looking into the Citi Premier offering an 80,000 point bonus for $4,000 spend in 3 months, the U.S. Bank Connect card offering 50,000 points for $2,000 spend in 4 months. The Bank of America Premium Rewards Card (a card slightly harder to get approved for though) which offers 50,000 points for $3,000 spend in 3 months but also pays potentially a 2.67% in cash rewards on top if you have a platinum honors status with Bank of America (if you hold $100k in assets with the bank or through their investing arm Merrill Edge). All points are 1 cent per point across all cards.\n\n3) By using Visa Business Credit Card and Plastiq. I know there is currently a promotion on the visa savings edge program (sign up for free online) of a 1% discount on the processing fee of 2.85% giving you a net fee of 1.85%. Perhaps you could find a business credit card which could come off ahead right off the gate with this rate. Some 2% cards include: FNBO Business Visa, Capital One Spark Business Cash Plus, U.S. Bank Leverage Visa card\n\n4) Check if the college charges a lower fee for debit cards, in which case you could get the affinity federal credit union cashback card giving you a 1% return if there is no fee involved. If there is a fee involved you could still check if the college is listed on the PayPal Bill Pay service which is a payment method that may allow you to pay without a fee directly to the school. Other cashback debit cards include the AMEX Business Checking or Discover Checking.\n\nLove finding challenges like this in coming ahead after convenience fees. Let me know if you have any questions :)",

It occurred to me that since my husband and I both have chase business accounts, that maybe we should put the payment on two cards, refer each other and get CIBU OR CIBC and get the $1500 SUB plus the $200 for the referrals. Plus there would be no annual fee for the cards, which I love. Granted, I’ll need to go through this process all over again come December (and every six months after that for a while!) so I’ll be keeping my eyes open for other deals!

You’d have to consider your options for the second year and beyond, just make sure you keep the cards open for at least a full year.

        "selftext": "As a parent of a student about to start college next month, I am trying to lessen the sting of tuition payment with credit card rewards. His school charges a convenience fee of 2.75% for using a card, but as we are planning to pay the balance right away, we thought the benefits received would outweigh this fee. In theory I think we could divide tuition between several cards but would at least plan to open two. We already have a CSP, Chase Business Ink, Unlimited, and Freedom. I’m wondering if anybody has any opinions on the cards giving the best benefits right now (if it makes a difference, we do love traveling though aren’t doing it at the moment). My husband does have an LLC registered which isn’t an active business at the moment, but I think would still make us eligible for another business card (?). I am so awed by the vast knowledge and expertise some have in this area, and would love to learn how to better leverage credit card rewards. I appreciate any thoughts/recommendations about current cc deals worth considering.",

This is a federal credit union so membership is not restrictive (you'll have to pay a one-time deposit to join tho).\n\nAll 3 cards have no AF.\n\nP.S. if you have a costco membership, look into their card (4%,+sign up benefits). If you have a Sam's club membership, look into their card (5% +sign up benefits). If you have a Verizon post-paid plan, look into the Verizon Visa (4% +sign up benefits).",

Unless you travel a lot, and love nicer hotels and biz class flights with plenty of vacation flex, you're almost certainly going to do better with cash liquidation and putting the money in tax advantaged securities/account over the long run.  Even a 40/60 or 60/40 portfolio absolutely crushes reasonable redemption value over time, especially when pricing in the AF for chase.And if you don't chase because of the AF, you still lose, maybe faster, because your rrv is so low. Like around 1.2 to 1.4 at max.  A 40% roi is nothing over time and points liquidation value is getting crushed by inflation if you bank points hoping for a big score.Collect points for \"free\" money fun or permission to splurge a little, not because it's a wise financial decision.",

As a whole Cuban’s pharmacy isn’t really going to change much as you can already get all the generic drugs he is selling for a few dollars a month with coupons like GoodRX. Cuban might save you $10 or so but not going to be taking the $300/month meds down to $30 or anything like that",

So, again… marginally cheaper but not remotely a solution to drug costs or a solution to a better healthcare system as a whole.

Travel cards really didn't help me much and I suspect it could be a similar situation with Disney. The best way to enjoy the parks is to stay at an on-site hotel, so that leaves out the points transfer options. Yes you can stay at a chain hotel with a shuttle to the park, but I always found the on-site hotel experience to be far better. Florida residents and annual pass holders usually qualify for a discount at these hotels. I found these discounted prices to be much lower than the prices on the travel portals. It's possible that the Chase portal could help because of the points bonuses, but compared to the cash price you could have paid, you won't be getting the full 25% or 50% redemption bonus. This is one situation where you might consider going with a cash back option or a pay yourself back.",

Look at what you pay when booking directly with Disney but also look at your credit card's travel portal and see what kind of deal you get there. At the time I booked at Universal I had a $100 hotel credit with my Citi card that I could have used if I booked through their portal. I didn't use it because the direct price with Universal was over $100 better than any portal on the internet! I suspect you might get a better deal with the Chase portal because of the 25% portal bonus but you have to compare it with the direct price. If you're only getting an actual 1.10 cpp points redemption instead of 1.25 cpp (because the direct price is lower) you have to consider the option of saving your points for a better deal. I personally never settle for less than 1.25 cpp because I know it's so easy to get with Chase points.",

The debit gets you 10% merchandise discounts, 10% of select restaurants, and access to a couple \"exclusive\" photo opportunities.  The select restaurant list is not extensive but there are some good ones on the list.  My wife has a Chase account that sits dormant most of the time except when we are going to Disney and I load it up for our inevitable merch spend.  The last time we went was in 2021, I was using my Discover most of time because our trip fell during a 5% restaurant bonus quarter.  All of the Disney dining locations categorized as a restaurants with Discover so your best bet is likely to use your best restaurant card (Savor??) at any dining spots that are not on the Disney Debit list.",

                "commentText": "Since you mentioned hotels, the very most valuable hotel transfer partner — bar none — is Hyatt. It's easy to get 2¢/point from Hyatt, whereas other chains are usually less than half that value. Since Chase is essentially Hyatt's only transfer partner, the Chase \"quadfecta\" you mentioned is ideal for this.\n\nAlso, since you're already considering Chase cards, be aware of their 5/24 rule. If you have 5 or more cards that show on your personal credit report as being opened in the past 24 months, Chase won't approve you for a new card. Business cards don't show on personal credit reports, so they don't count toward 5/24. For this reason, I'd suggest replacing the CFU you desire with a CIU. The CIU also has a MUCH better welcome bonus.\n\nIf you're over 5/24 now, getting business cards such as BBP will not impact your 5/24 status, so that'd be best if you want Chase cards in the future.\n\nAs an example hotel redemption, a 3-night stay at Hyatt Place Orlando/Lake Buena Vista comes to $625.12. But if you pay with points, you only need 28,500 Chase points. That works out to 2.2¢/point. (The same 28,500 could be cashed out for $285 — you’re getting 2.2 times the value at Hyatt than you would by cashing out the points.)\n\nAlternatively, if you want to pay cash for luxury hotels, American Express' [Fine Hotels and Resorts program](https://www.americanexpress.com/en-us/travel/discover/) is hard to beat. It gives you benefits better than a hotel's top-tier status… but luxury stays can still be expensive.",

You’ll still have to pay the resort fees even with the free nights though ($50 or so per night).\n\nYou’re eligible for these sign up bonuses every 24 months, so my wife and I will both jump on the offer to get 6 to 10 nights for free. These hotels are walking distance to EPCOT and HS. This takes care of a huge chunk of our trip cost and let’s us spend more of our budget on experiences! 🙂",

If you have room in your 5/24 for Chase, get a CSP and/or Amex gold for better multipliers so you can transfer points to airlines for flights or redeem on amextravel or Chase’s portal. If you got an Amex Platinum, you can alternatively book FHR properties which have a ton of benefits (free breakfast, room upgrade, resort credit, etc.), some of which I believe have free shuttles to the parks. Another alternative - look into Costco’s vacation packages, which have discounted rates for WDW, and you could get 2% back with a Citi Costco credit card. I forget if it qualifies but you could also pay the extra $60/year for an executive membership to get an extra 2% back. Really comes down to what type of experience you want at WDW. Like someone else said, passholders get tons of benefits in the parks, like discounts on food and merch. The Chase Disney cards are trashy in my opinion - not worth the credit pull nor the annual fee. \n\nI wouldn’t close your no AF cards - it’s a waste. Put one small purchase on each every few years to extend your average account length.\n\nThe biggest advice I’d give you going forward is try to get cards in the future that contribute to a reliable setup. Your setup seems a little haphazard and disorganized. At your income level, you won’t have enough spend across so many platforms that you’d want to earn points across multiple systems at a time. Personally, I think you’d see more reward committing to one main rewards platform (e.g., Amex MR, Chase UR, Marriott, Hyatt, or a particular airline) whose multiplier categories are in line with your highest spend categories.",

We also used the $200 airline credit for our checked baggage fees and our inflight cocktails (cuz that’s how we fly with kids). Oh, and on the way back, we had lounge access so that was nice. \n\nIn the park, we used the cap one savor one, but almost everything coded as just dining or merchandise. I had expected some things to code as entertainment, but no.

Hey guys, so I am a Florida Resident who is planning a Disney World Vacation this summer for my family. After reading in this subreddit, I decided to pursue a Capital One and get the Venture X later this year since I already own the Savor One. This is ideal because I can use the $300 credit for hotels. However, I am heavily considering going into a second ecosystem, and I'm picking between Chase and American Express. I'm trying to pick an ecosystem that is best for my spending habits and locality.I have a Chase Amazon Visa Card and an Amex BCP that I plan on downgrading. I got an offer from Chase in which I can apply for their checkings account and get a $300 Bonus, and I heard you could get a Disney Debit card that has certain benefits for Disney. So basically, I'm considering whether getting the Amex Gold/BBP or Chase Freedom Unlimited/Sapphire Preferred. Even then, im not sure if it's a good idea given I'm likely getting the Captial One Bifecta. If it helps, I don't really have a preference torwards Hotels cause I've never done this before, however, it seems Wyndham Hilton, and Holiday Innare the main Hotels I'd be interested in transferring to.As for airlines I don't know anything about them, however near my airport, it seems American Airlines and Delta are the main ones that seem most prevalent for domestic travel.Household Income: $90kAge: 23Cards owned: 11 (Planning to close 4 of them)My cards:(Chase) Amazon Prime Signature Visa: $2800(AMEX) Blue Cash Everyday: $4000  (Capital One) SavorOne $10,000 (Wells Fargo) Active Cash $2700 (Wells Fargo) Autograph $4000(Discover) Discover It Cashback Card: $5500  (STORE CARD) Target REDCard $500 (Synchrony) CareCredit Card $15kPlanning to close:(Synchrony) Paypal Mastercard(Synchrony) Paypal Credit Line(Store Card) Macy's CardWanting to open:(Chase) CFU, CFF, CIC, CSP(AMEX) Gold Card, BBP",

Sure, you might have other medical bills to “cover” the gains, but the decision to defer an HSA withdrawal isn’t as obvious as it seems.

They are generally garbage. So my HSA will be of great use here, 60 years from now.Edit: Example: My grandfather went into a paid nursing home (decent, nothing extravagant) that cost him $5k monthly, when his retirement account depleted he was forced to move to a new nursing (accepted Medicare and was terrible) home at 94 years old.

But about 1/3 of people die without needing long term care. Dying with a large HSA balance (which you could accumulate if you save and invest the money for decades) is much less tax-friendly compared to dying with a large taxable account because there is no step-up basis on the HSA, unlike the taxable account.Nursing home expenses are generally tax deductible, so you could sell a lot of taxable investments at a 0% capital gains rate to cover those costs--making your taxable account nearly \"tax free\" in this scenario (except for dividend taxes paid while working/retired)",

When money from your HSA is used on healthcare expenses it’s exempt from any income and capital gains tax. It’s valuable to wait until retirement because of compound interest. HSA family limit is $7,750. If you contributed for 20 years and spend it over those years that’s $155,000 that was tax exempt. However, if you let it compound for the 20 years instead at 6% post-inflation, that’s $302,000 (also tax exempt), effectively doubling your money just by waiting. In retirement you’ll also have the most medical expenses, so having all that money available is great in the case of unexpected needs. Once you reach retirement age you can also withdraw money for non-health expenses and pay deferred income tax only (making it equal to a 401(k)). Lastly, you can save healthcare receipts for decades and cash them all out whenever you want to withdraw money from your HSA tax free. So if you were to spend $50,000 on healthcare in those 20 years, you could withdraw $50,000 at once using the receipts and not pay the deferred tax on that amount. tl/dr: use on healthcare in retirement and it’s permanently untaxed money that’s grown due to compound interest. Use in retirement on other purchases and the account is basically a 401(k).This is why the account is called a Stealth IRA.",

We found an Alaska Airlines credit card where you can earn a free roundtrip 'companion ticket', but it only applies to their flights which are limited to North America. If it could have gotten us to Europe that might have helped us.Are there any other credit cards you know of that might help us get a good discount for our flight to Qatar? Or at least to Europe or something?Thank you!Here's our recommendation request template. I'm not the one who will be applying for the card, so I can't be certain about some of these details: CREDIT PROFILE* \\* Current credit cards you are the primary account holder of: U.S. Bank $10,000 limit, opened 5/2022* \\* FICO Scores with source: good credit, I couldn't tell you the score though* \\* Oldest credit card account age with you as primary name on the account: bank of america $10,000 limit, 03/2019* \\* Number of personal credit cards approved for in the past 6 months: 1* \\* Annual income $: *$20,000 maybe? workmans compensation so I don't know*CATEGORIES* \\* OK with category-specific cards?: *no, unless for travel** \\* OK with rotating category cards?: *no** \\* Estimate average monthly spend in the categories below. Only include what you can pay by credit card.   * \\* Dining $: 100   * \\* Groceries $: *100*   * \\* Gas $: *200*   * \\* Travel $: 0 - aside from this trip which will be maybe $5000 in flights, hotel   * \\* Do you plan on using this card abroad for a significant length of time (study abroad, digital nomad, expat, extended travel)?: yes, one month in Qatar   * \\* Can you pay rent by credit card?

My cards currently: Amex Blue Cash Everyday card,Amazon Prime Rewards Visa card, Citi Custom Cash MasterCard, PayPal Cashback Mastercard,Credit Union Visa Credit card (no Cashback or Rewards)I've heard that the PayPal Cashback Mastercard works to send money and get 3% Cashback but PayPal fees are high for sending money... Like $3 or 3% i can't remember for friends and family.. Was going to also get the Bilt credit card for this but not all the money I send will pay my rent and the card has a 5 transaction requirement for rent points plus a 50k points cap on rent so probably not worth getting that specific card..

We’re pretty loyal to Hyatt, so I opened a WoH card from Chase (with the intent of partly offsetting the honeymoon) and will max out the sign up from that, still having thousands in expenses. I’ve been considering opening another card for the rest, but haven’t decided if I will or not. The WF Autograph does 3% on catering, so that’s interesting and may be relevant to you, depending on what the venue is categorized as. I’m also considering a Sapphire Preferred for SUB and to transfer my Freedom Flex points to Hyatt for an even easier honeymoon. It’s hard for me to justify the Reserve, Amex Platinum, etc. given my spending patterns. Worst case I may just use my 2% Active Cash card for the remainder.",

In different months these both can be a big category for me, especially if i pick up the tab and get reimbursed later. I currently have a Capital One Quicksliver with a $7000 credit limit, which has been open since Feb 2019. My mom also opened the same card for me when I was a kid and has 100% on time payments, she uses this once every few months just to build my credit.I also have a Amex Blue Cash Preferred where I get 6% back on groceries and 3% on gas. Credit limit is $12k and its been open since 01/2020.I have a Citi double cash card with a 8.5k credit limit which has been open since feb 2022. This card is used in a joint account for one of my hobbies only. I am self employed so my income is variable but is significant enough to not be worried about everyday expenses and fund a small airplane. I do not want to open a business card. For this restaurant / bar card, I would consider anything over 3% return. I am open to points as long as the cash equivalent is at least 3%. I don't particularly care about the sign up bonus, I am looking for long term use on this card. I don't mind an annual fee as I can generally use the perks elsewhere. Do any cards specifically mention bars? I saw one the other day but did not save it. My credit is in the high 700's.&amp;#x200B;I am currently looking at these cards but am open to suggestions.* [Amex Gold](https://www.nerdwallet.com/reviews/credit-cards/american-express-premier-rewards-gold) \\- nervous about having 2 amex as my top cards since not everywhere takes them* Chase Freedom unlimited* Chase Sapphire Preferred* Citi Premier  - 3x at restaurants&amp;#x200B;I am excited for your suggestions.TIA&amp;#x200B;edit: currently editing to fit template more accurately",

Bonus: if there is any better card to put majority of your bills and subscriptions on that you guys recommended then let me hear it. Right now I put subscriptions on an AMEX BCP since it has 6% back on most subs; and bills (SF &amp; Xfinity) on Venmo CC (State Farm only counts for 1% hence why I want to switch)Thanks for the replies!",

If you have a preferred airline and they have a card with benefits like included baggage and travel insurance, then maybe that would be worth it. I would say don’t worry about a travel card until you have an idea for a trip and then decide if it makes sense. (I got the CSP right before a big trip to Peru). Definitely sign up for the airline rewards program once you book a flight. If you get a mileage plus rewards program with United, you can even earn United miles with normal online shopping without a special credit card. You can then tack that on to other normal cash back rewards you get through a different card.\n\nWhat I would recommend though is a card like chase freedom unlimited or chase freedom flex. You still get some of the benefits like travel delay insurance and second car rental coverage without an annual fee. And you can earn chase\nUltimate rewards points through the CFF and CFU that could one day be transferred to a chase sapphire preferred to maximize value if that makes sense for you. You can also earn 5x cash back/in points if you book through the chase travel portal with your CFF or CFU. And you can use the points you earned to book a flight in the portal one day if you want to.\n\nThe truth is that a $95+ annual fee doesn’t really make sense for most people unless you travel a lot. You probably would be better off by saving the $95, opening a card like CFF, and then earning cash back. Either save the rewards points for future use or cash them out and put it in a high yield savings account.",

                "commentText": "&gt;I’ve seen some stuff with Amex and Chase Sapphire Reserve, but I just don’t want to make the mistake of going to big and being saddled with tons of debt.\n\nBeing saddled with tons of debt has absolutely nothing to do with what card you carry. 0.0%, nothing. No matter what card you get, remember it's not a loan. Don't use it for anything you cannot already pay for. Use it like a debit card, pay it off in full every month, and watch your credit score rise.\n\nThe secret to winning this game is to not to alter your spending or start buying more stuff just because you have a credit card -- what you want to do is funnel spending you already do through one or more cards that will reward you somehow for those spends.\n\nHaving said that, if this is your first card and you are hoping to build credit you absolutely do not need to spend money on a premium card like those.\n\nChase Sapphire Preferred is pretty good start if you want to earn mileage points that can be redeemed within the Chase ecosystem of travel partners. It's a $95 AF (Annual Fee) card; you probably don't need to spend that on a card, but on this card at least the benefits might help offset the AF.\n\nChase Freedom Flex and Freedom Unlimited are both $0 AF cards which also get you into the Chase ecosystem. You'll have to compare benefits and features vs the Sapphire Preferred to see if the extra $95 is worth it considering your spending habits.\n\nSome people like to build a \"chase Trifecta,\" which is a wallet of three Chase cards, usually including the premium Sapphire Reserve. You can google to learn more, but basically what they are doing is maximizing the Chase rewards system; the Sapphire Reserve allows you to redeem points at 1.5x value, and you can transfer points from other Chase cards. They each have different reward tiers for different categories of spending. Use the card that gives the highest reward for that category, then transfer points to the Sapphire Reserve before you redeem them to get 50% more value out of them.  \n\nThat can be a lot of work though, and it may not be worth it for someone with modest spending habits.  \n\nPersonally I like the Capital One Savor One as a good \"one size fits all\" for their simple cash rewards systems. It's not really a \"travel card\" but it does offer some travel-friendly features, like lost luggage insurance, flight cancellation insurance, and rental car insurance. Also it's no FTF (Foreign Transaction Fee) which is uncommon for a $0 AF card. The Savor One features 3% cash back on dining, grocery, entertainment and streaming, which is pretty good. Also currently 10% back on Uber and Uber Eats, 5% on hotels and rental cars booked through the Capital One travel portal, 8% back on entertainment purchases made through their portal, and 1% on everything else. The rewards show up as points on your statement, which can apply to your statement balance, be redeemed for cash, or be spent on things booked through Capital One.  \n\nIf you spend $300 a month on 3% categories, that $3,600 a year, = $108 cash back to you. At that point Cap One is basically paying you $108 a year just to carry and use their card.\n\nOf course if you *don't* pay it off in full each month and incur interest charges you will probably not be ahead of the game at the end of the year. don't ever pay a penny in interest. Use it correctly and the advertised APR is literally meaningless to you because you are never going to pay it.",

Many will open a new card every 3 months without ruling out any card they want (except for Chase cards, due to 5/24).The impact of a new account on a credit score is small — and it gets even smaller if your credit history is stronger. Even the tiny impact that an inquiry has on your score is eliminated after 13 months.",

Citi may deny you if you have 6 hard inquiries in the last 6 months. And while other issuers may reject you for having too many recent credit cards, they mostly care about ones that you sign up for with them. An example is Bank of America, which limits you to 2 BoA cards in 2 months, 3 BoA cards in 12 months, and 4 BoA cards in 24 months. BoA's limits don't look at accounts from other banks.For anyone who isn't churning credit cards or signing up for many at the same time, you're generally safe from any denials or punishments from lendors based on recent inquiries.&amp;#x200B;Additionally, while inquiries impact your credit score for 12 months, it's generally a very minor impact. In many cases, the available credit/utilization and account mix factors from signing up for a new card may outweigh the temporary hit from the new inquiry and result in a higher score and any hit related to account ages should correct &amp;#x200B;In short, inquiries only really matter for 12 months, and they don't generally have a very strong impact.",

That way you can split up payments and pay it back before the zero percent interest rate expires. Do carefully read zero percent APR offer carefully so don't get burned.\n\nDid see Disney/Chase has a zero percent 6 month APR offer for some packages (they do cruises) plus a sign up bonus, but you can get better offers elsewhere.",

They have offers and frequently you will see $150 or $200 back on the card if you spend $500 booking a cruise. I've seen these offers for Royal Caribbean and for Celebrity. There was also one for Carnival and I think for river cruises. If you book through an agent, check if they work with Amex. Frequently you will get extra onboard credit and other perks.

Of course, a $9.99 transaction also earns $.10 back, and even a $10.01 transaction is only getting $.20 (2%). \n\nThe bigger question may be what fraction of your spending this makes up. Gaming spend is easily visible, but if you're totaling $50/mo in-game yet haven't optimized your $55/ spent on an internet connection, probably look at that first.",

I'd get the C1 Venture X card. 2x miles (points) on every purchase, no AF, priority pass and plaza premium worldwide lounge access. It does have a $395 annual fee, but every year you are given $300 worth of travel credit + 10,000 bonus miles (valued at $100). So if you travel at least once a year, you are effectively being paid $5 to keep the card. \n\nThere is something called the \"ugami\" card which is specifically marketed toward gamers but idk much about it.\n\nHope this helped",

For this method, you transfer points into an American alliance partner, like British Airways. Using your newly transferred British Airways Avios, you can then search for award flights on American, but booked through BA.\n\nA disclaimer for this though, is that sometimes that exact same flight you see on American's website for XX miles won't be available for booking on British Airways website at all. Airlines only release a certain amount of award tickets to their alliance partners.",

AA miles are tough to accrue outside their co branded credit cards (or ya know, actually flying with them) at the moment. \n\nThe other route you could go is to use a chase csp/trifecta to earn ur points and then book your AA flights thru the chase travel portal for 1.25 cpp (or 1.5 cpp with csr) since tbh idk if you would get above that value using AA points for domestic economy flights.",

I’m starting to consider the WF BILT card for cash back on rent when the time comes. On the other side, I’ve always wanted a AMEX gold card, no real reason, just always wanted one.

One exception: the PenFed Pathfinder which is basically $0 AF as long as you keep $500 in a PenFed checking account. \n\nThere are lots of ways you could approach this, but I suggest being mindful of the bigger picture of cards that will benefit you at home as well as abroad.\n\nAlso, avoid Amex, due to acceptance issues (stick with Visa and MasterCard).",

Essentially making it a $10 fee in your case. You will earn 4x points back on restaurants and groceries. If your absolutely set on getting statement credit, it works out to about 2.4% cash back. As far as getting credits for the hotels… If you’re not interested in getting any travel rewards points, I’d just stick to a 2% cash back card. You could do the Amex Green for 3x back but when you redeem for statement credit, your back at 2%…\n\nI personally always use a hotel branded card at hotels ( I know you’re not interested ), but it could allow you to take a spectacular vacation you normally wouldn’t take. The Marriott cards get a you at least 16x back in points when combined with their Bonvoy program (6x from the card) and since your traveling a lot, it could really make some unbelievable memories for yourself and family or friends.",

So I can’t see how you’d justify the Sapphire’s effective $250 fee just to get 3% cash back. I agree with u/Hitfactor that the US Bank Altitude Reserve is probably your best bet. Pay for work travel, redeem your rewards for work travel, and keep the extra cash. (You still charge the travel to your card as a US Dollars transaction, so unlike travel portals, this can in no way affect work reimbursement or add travel complications.) Effective 4.5% cash back for all US travel and Apple Pay for an effective $75 fee. That could be a majority of your transactions. Other runners up include the Alliant 2.5% card and the 3% Citi Premier, but you should come out far ahead with the Altitude Reserve.",

I don't travel much for fun though, so airline miles, hotel reward points... they're all pretty useless for me. Instead, I like to use my rewards for statement credits or cash back.Outside of this, I spend a ton of money on dining &amp; doordash, as well as a fair bit of groceries. Currently my credit scheme looks like this:* Amazon Prime Visa - Amazon Orders* Citi DoubleCash - Everything ElseI'd like to add in 1-2 cards that will allow me to get more than 2% cashback on dining, hotels, and car rentals; while also having an annual fee that I can justify.What do you think the best fit for me would be?I was considering the Chase Sapphire Reserve. I think between the travel credit and doordash/instacart memberships I should be able to offset the fee... just not sure if there are better options at there?",

I just don't know what's a smart choice that'll actually benefit me in terms of returns/savings. I see people getting free flights and stuff using points but i don't know what card to get. I current have a BoA account with BoA travel rewards card and an Apple card, there's some cash back/points but doesn't seem very beneficial. credit score: 711 (transunion) , 726 (experian)  (i have sometimes forgotten to pay card in time, trying to be better by setting reminders) I am about to graduate in may and will be earning $110k a year in SeattleI have been spending about $10,000 a year on travel, probably this year too. Maybe more in future years? or less if work? not sure. Flights are the bulk of it, i look for cheap accommodations/airbnbs usually (but can go towards hotels if there's credit card value). $50-100 for museums/attractions otherwise, a day. It would be nice to have the option to skip security lines/get upgraded on 9+ hour flights for not a huge amount of money/using points but the main goal is to have the best returns on card. I will try to do sign up bonus (will be spending $5200 for something very soon)\\[other info: will probably have a $2000-3000 rent, might lease a car for a year and then decide to buy or not (idk costs), i only spend as much as needed on food, groceries, shopping etc (trying to minimize eating out/spending too much), living alone\\]",

Amex is another option with good travel transfer partners, but their fees are high and they try to justify it with endless coupons. I don't buy into that, but they do have a large fanbase that will all tell you they get great value from them.",

Based on my calculation this will generate 345k points and require us to spend $1185 in AF. I also read that we can transfer all the points from each card to one card holder (not sure if this is correct as I plan to move all the points under my account).Would this be the maximum amount of points we can generate?

We get rewards and it’s easier to track expenses this way so it works for us. We recently realized that we have to get some foundation work done for our house and the estimated cost for the work is between $13k to $17k. I really do not want to drain our savings for it or take out a loan we will have to pay interest on. I had the thought to apply for some other credit cards with an interest free period of 12-15 months and charge the repair to them instead. That way we can build our credit further, not touch our savings, and avoid paying interest. I just am not sure of the best way of achieving this. Any advice on requesting a higher card limit with your initial application, which cards would be best, or other advice on this strategy would be very appreciated. For further info, my FICO credit score is around 790 and my husband’s is around 650. Thank you all in advance!",

That's where the 6 pulls come from. That said it's not a really big influence as credit history (on time payments) and average length. This is why you have many credit cards. In the future when you need to open another credit card or even a car loan, the length of a new card (0 years) will be balanced by however many credit cards you open now.",

The no-AF travel cards usually pay only 3% back on travel, and parking doesn't even count as \"travel\" on a number of those cards. The only no-AF 5% back on travel card I can think of (*other than the Citi Custom Cash*) is the geofenced [Vantage West Connect Rewards](https://vantagewest.org/personal/credit-cards/connect-rewards-visa/), and that's limited to Arizona and even then I don't know whether their definition of \"travel\" would pick up parking.(I guess there's also the BoA Customized Cash with Preferred Rewards status, but you'd need to have $100k invested with BoA to break the 5% cashback barrier with that credit card.)So, keep the Citi Custom Cash for the parking, and get an alternate card for gas. The Abound CU Visa Platinum is the one I usually recommend when the Citi Custom Cash isn't an option for gas. The Abound card pays unlimited 5% cashback on gas. It's a Visa, so it works at Costco Gas. And its FTF is only 1%, so it's even usable (as an effectively 4% cashback on gas card) outside the U.S.If you're not a very heavy driver and not laser-focused on getting 5% cashback, it might make more sense for you to pick up one of the 4% cashback on gas cards instead. Some of those cards come with lucrative SUBs; the Abound card doesn't have a SUB.Oh, one last note. Have you looked into whether your work offers a pretax parking benefit program? If you can pay for all or part of your parking using pretax dollars, that'd *far* outstrip anything you'd save with a cashback credit card. Companies in cities where parking is expensive tend to offer a pretax parking benefit as a perk.",

                "commentText": "The biggies for travel are: Amex Platinum, Amex Gold, Chase Sapphire Reserve, Chase Sapphire Preferred, Capital One Venture X, Citi Premiere.\n\nAmex Plat: $695 AF, huge SUB, TONS of credits to use but this will require careful management + I find some to be advertised a bit misleadingly (e.g., $200 hotel credit BUT only w/ their signature hotel line thing, $200 flight credit BUT only for incidentals like checking bags not actual airline fares), but also top tier benefits (also tons to manage but seems like they rly do take care of u). If you can make use of all the credits, you can completely offset the AF and then some.\n\nChase Sapphire Reserve: this is my fave (in theory, I don't have it) but I think it only makes sense if you travel a lot. $550 AF, $300 travel credit that counts towards ANY travel (airline fares, rideshare, etc.) and doesn't even have to be booked through Chase portal which is super convenient, it has great points earning potential (including dining!) but this is where the caveat of having to travel/spend enough on flights/hotels/car rentals to offset the remaining $250 comes into play. If you use your points for travel, they're also worth 1.5 cents each rather than 1 cent, which is a nice alternative to transferring.\n\nCapital One Venture X: I've just gotten this myself a few weeks ago. $395 AF, $300 travel credit for anything booked through their portal (a step down from CSR but very fair), 10000 annual bonus miles (value = $100 when redeemed for travel). Adding this up, this card is effectively paying you $5 per year to own it w/ simple usage. Also, good points on travel via their portal, and 2x points on all purchases is super solid. A downside is they have 0 domestic airline partners, but yes to hotels and there are ways around this w/ their other airline partners.\n\nAmex Gold: $250 AF, $240 (120 for uber + 120 for grubhub) in credits but in $10 monthly allocations so a bit tricky to get pure max value but if you order from those already 1x/month then the value is easy. This card shines bc it gives 4x points at restaurants + groceries, but only 3x for travel, which is lower than all the other cards (amex plat + CSR + Venture X range from 5x-10x on travel purchases). This could be good tho if you don't have cards yet for your food purchases of $500/month and aren't spending tons on travel yet. Also have to book through Amex portal for the travel points.\n\nChase Sapphire Preferred: $95/99 AF (cant remember), $50 hotel credit is solid enough, good points categories. They do a similar thing as w/ the CSR where u get a bonus to redeem points for travel, but they're only worth 1.25 cents w/ CSP compared to 1.5 cents w/ CSR.\n\nCiti premiere: $95/99 AF (cant remember), lower points rewards on travel at 3x, but also 3x points coverage for restaurants + groceries + gas. ngl I kno the least about this card but it seems like a good simple card to use for a variety of purchases, esp if ur already in the Citi ecosystem.\n\nCommonalities: these cards all have sizeable SUBs and extensive travel insurance coverages, you'll have to look up each to compare and see which set you pref. the way to max any of these rewards is via transferring points to their travel partners. the way the points will work is that u can either take points to redeem for statement credit or travel credit (usually at 1 cent/point - the CSP + CSR give u more towards travel, Amex gives u less towards statement credit) or send those points to a partner (e.g., delta, american airlines, Hyatt, etc.) and then book something via that partner website directly, and their deals when buying with points will frequently return at much higher cent/point ratios (CSR example: 10000 points is worth $100 statement credit, $150 travel credit, or $300 towards a hotel stay if you transfer the points). There are definitely bunches of other travel cards, but hopefully this helps some!\n\nDisclaimer: this is 99% from memory, and even though I'm p confident, pls double check specifics for these reward rates/credits/etc lol\n\nEdit: just looked back at ur cards, and an important note is that u can combine ur chase points. so points from that chase freedom u have can basically be moved to the CSR/CSP to further ur benefits. this creates a situation where u can use the CSR/CSP rewards redemptions w/o even having spent any more on those cards (many people do this with the CSP, I think having the CSR would effectively require considerable spending to make it worth it). I'm unsure if you can pool points this way w/ Capital One (hopefully someone else can comment on this) so unsure if the same goes for ur Quicksilver and a potential Venture X. Capital One do also offer \"lower\" options in the Venture lineup, but I think if u go w/ Capital One then the Venture X makes sense bc it's again effectively free so makes sense to get the \"best\" card, but for completion it can't hurt to look at the Venture and Venture One cards too!",

The Centurion lounges are also nice and let you get free drinks and free food. And you can transfer your Amex points to Delta for flight redemptions. Or you can transfer to other airlines for your honeymoon. And it has a high sign up bonus.\n\nThe Plat annual fee is very high though so you'd have to consider if you can make use of the perks and the various credits to make the fee worth it. It's not for everyone because of that. But if you travel a decent amount and think you can make use of the sign up points it's well worth it.\n\nYou can add your fiancé as an authorized user for $175 so they can have the same lounge access that you get. Or just have them sign up for their own card for the sign up bonus too (make sure you refer them to get referral bonus points).\n\nNot sure it'd be worth getting a Delta plat over your current Delta Gold. You can look at the perks and figure out if the additional annual fee is worth it. The companion pass is notoriously difficult to use (has to be a full fare round trip flight with specific ticket codes) so don't necessarily count on using that. I've had the card 4 years and still have yet to be able to use that (though I'm not at a Delta hub so don't fly Delta that often) and only keep renewing it because I get good enough retention offers to make it barely worthwhile.",

Love the free checked bags since I travel about 10-15 times a year, most times with my SO who also gets the free bag if I book for him. We have mostly been traveling domestically, but are looking into Asia and Europe trips within the next year or so.I also have the Marriot Bonvoy credit card, which I don’t really use as much. I bought this about 3 yeas ago. Nice to have when I need a hotel, but wouldn’t mind canceling this one honestly. I am now ready to “upgrade” my travel experience and maximize more benefits. My SO and I are actually getting married and plan to expense our honeymoon to a new card- this should help unlock any bonus offers. Many friends have recommended the Chase Sapphire Reserve or the AMEX Platinum. Booking travel with these will get us more points and it’ll get us into lounges. I’ve missed the Sky Club experience, but I know they’re not at every airport. My Mom said the Centurion Lounge benefit is awesome with AMEX, but I don’t know if I need a super luxury lounge. More so, I miss being able to grab a casual drink and some sort of snack pre-flight.I was also researching the Delta AMEX Platinum, which I think I’m overdue for at this point with the amount I’m flying. How does that work if I also want the CSR or standard AMEX Platinum? Or do I just go all in on one?Any help or advice is appreciated!! Thank you kind strangers in advance and let me know if there’s any other questions!",

Length of time you had it open,  maybe shows up as AAoA,  but I'm not exactly sure... probably does...  which also helps.  Despite the sarcasm from your wife,  obviously it is probably a good idea to open some lines of credit as you have learned demonstratively that not having them doesn't help anything,  and makes it harder to further or get the best rates on things like a mortgage or autoloan,  and if you and she are applying together for that kinda thing,   the loan is going to be based on the lowest middle score generally of BOTH of you.  So she could have an 850 FICO8 score or whatever,  and you would be paying rates together of your 680...I'm sure she won't like that even more you know?So yeah,  you are going to need to build your score up,  which is going to happen eventually with more lines of credit and being responsible and on time,  every time,  and don't pay interest kinda thing,  and rinse and repeat.When you take on a new line of credit,  your scores will go down momentarily as you are getting a hard pull,  adding a line of credit,  AAoA's, etc etc,   not to mention you are adding to what is considered a VERY thin profile.... But you definitely need to take that one step back to take two steps forward,  as it's going to effect your financial credit hygiene,   not only for you,   but for your wife and family,   as in this situation,  with any joint purchases,  you could be the boat anchor you know?And with interest rates what they are now,  you don't want to be paying more then the best rates....",

All cards that report of the bureaus (the vast, vast majority of them) will build your credit exactly the same way. On the new card(s), do not ever let a balance carry and pay it in full every month. The couple months you apply for new credit (loans) you can pay off the balance early before close to maximize score\n\nFor which cards: given you have most spend on Costco and everyplate, a flat rate earning visa is my recommendation. The logix card is nice, but a mastercard, so useless at Costco. If you don't travel abroad, the wells fargo active cash is the simplest flat rate card.

Considering your main grocery spend is at Costco, the Costco Visa by Citi would earn you 3% on dining, 4% on fuel, and 2% back at Costco which is your biggest grocery spend, and it also boosts your gas spend, which not many cards do.

I have not applied for a new credit card since then. At the time, I assumed it would help my credit score, but in fact it did the opposite. My score was highest when I carried a monthly balance on the Capital One card, so I would like to apply for a new card with no intention of ever closing it.

What credit card will give us lounge access regardless of the airport? I mean which card gives you the most access to the most lounges.I believe Philly airport only has AA and centurion loans and Amex is changing rules next year. I had read somewhere that adding my spouse to CSR as an authorized user will be the best option, just wanted to make sure I am not missing anything. But this will not give us access to any lounge in our main airport.TIA",

I’m also super glad I downgraded the card after the trip as I otherwise don’t travel often enough (at least not personal travel) to justify the AF, and even if I did now that they’re changing the rules on guests it makes it a bit less worth the money.

I've had the card since November 2013, the APR is 11.24%. My credit score is currently 748.I guess 2 questions- would I be better off just using the credit I have, or opening a new card?The cards suggested to me from another sub have been the U.S. Bank Altitude card, the  Wells Fargo Reflex card ( it redirected to the Wells Fargo Reflect card when I went to search for it, though), and the Discover it card.&amp;#x200B;If it means anything, I don't intend to use the card for anything else, really. Any suggestions?

If you somehow can’t get a general presale code, most have a credit card presale as well for similar/mostly the same tickets before the general sale. Sometimes they also have “preferred” seats, which are a little more expensive because they’re aisle seats or closer to the stage. \n\nAs far as companies who do partner with Ticketmaster for presale: Citi, Capital One and American Express are all I know of. I think it’s all dependent on the artist. A lot of concerts I’ve gotten tickets to recently recently have had Citi presale. Taylor Swift was Capital One (which didn’t end up happening). I haven’t seen American Express in a while! \n\nI hope that helps.\n\nCapital",

Years ago I had an American Express card that allowed me presales to many Ticketmaster shows. Now it seems like I see a lot of Citi bank presales.

They will be giving me a housing stipend of $7500 for housing as well as a complete reimbursement for any travel flights and meals I have. Because I will be spending the money either way, I wanted to look into applying for a credit card that would allow me to accumulate the most points possible when spending this money. I would prefer to have points for flights or hotels. But I’m open to any options. I have around a 680 Fico credit score. I have little knowledge about credit cards but I want to get as much knowledge as possible to make the most of this incredible opportunity. Thank you all!!",

Now with this card you can select two category every quarter that will give you 5% which includes (Department store, utilities, electronic stores, etc.). With being new home owner you might be able to use this card to get 5% on some of your purchases.",

I'm thinking of making the following additions/changes:* Removing the Amex Gold and adding the Amex cash for 6% for groceries. * Adding a free general spending card with 2+%* Another rotating 5% card to increase the chances of cashback in any given quarter (e.g. Walmart, Paypal, ...)Are you OK with catégorie spending or do you want a general spending card?I'm both looking into category spending cards and a general spending card. I feel like getting a 2+% CB credit card is a no-brainer. Do you have any recommendations? What's a good card to complement the Discover IT card for 5% rotating spending? Or should I just go for a general spending card?",

If you're a budget traveler shopping for the best deals, economy flights, and modest hotels you'll be using the cash back option a lot. That's also where Chase's 25% travel portal boost is useful too. I will probably never get less than 1.25 cpp on UR points.The transfer partners work best for people with flexible travel plans who book well in advance and value luxury. But there's also the traveler who would normally book economy but he sees a good deal on first or business class or a luxury Hyatt hotel and chooses that because he's not pulling much cash to do it.",

If you do A LOT of Costco shopping, that adds up quickly. I know it has a $400 fee but $325 is relatively easy to recoup via their annual credit. \n\nChase is a solid setup. The pay yourself back feature over the last year or so has been amazing if you could not travel/do not travel. Ultimate Rewards are valuable because of three of their transfer partners (Hyatt, United, and Southwest) - which no other banks have. Citi doesn’t even have American Airlines as a transfer partner even though their co-branded cards are through Citi. \n\nAmerican Express is good because their initial sign up bonuses are amongst the highest but they also have some of the highest annual fees. It is up to the individual to determine if it’s worthwhile but you can generate some serious membership rewards in a relatively short period of time compared to Citi or Chase (Unless you get the Ink lineup). If you have the Schwab AMEX Platinum, you gain the ability to cash out your points to Schwab at .011 cent per point, so with the current 100,000 point sign up bonus, at a cash level it’s worth $1,100 plus all of the benefits that the AMEX Platinum comes with. If you’re able to add a Gold at 90,000 and the Green at 50,000+ then you’re looking at 240,000 or $2,640 of straight cash back on 3 cards. I think the AMEX points are more difficult to redeem than Chase’s but are easier than Citi’s as Citi lacks many domestic partnerships in their rewards program. \n\nCapital One looks like it can be great as well between the Savor and the Venture X but approvals seem all over the place but this two card combo would the simplest to more than likely maximize the benefits.",

Like they’re open to it in the future, but they are not planning to jump into it yet. They may live in driving distance to family and friends, and they may often drive to vacation destinations instead of always flying. So flying/staying at hotels isn’t a regular thing they know they’ll do every year, so it’s unclear if going the travel rewards route would be worth it to them. They may end up sticking just with cash back forever, or trying out travel rewards and then going back to cash back if it wasn’t worth it for them (either because of value or time and effort).An alternative is building the best possible cash back setup and then opening new cards for a travel setup if they decide to later. While it’s okay to stop using old cards, it could have a significant effect on your average credit line age. Keeping them open with one yearly expense is doable, but an extra chore you have to remember now for each card. So I’m wondering if there’s a simpler and better middle ground for people who are on the fence about using travel rewards in the future",

I actually like the $50 Chase hotel credit more than the $100 Citi hotel credit because Citi's $500 minimum stay. To me both cards easily justify their fees even if you only travel occasionally. I know the VentureX credits easily pay for the annual fee, but if you have a year when you don't use the travel credit then it's not worth it so you need to be sure you will use it.",

You can do that even if you use Premier to transfer points, so that's one advantage to having both. I think Citi does have better earning cards, especially for groceries and gas which is important. But I also like the CFF more than I thought I would, now that I'm using it. The categories they pick are generally quite useful and they have multiple categories. For example, this quarter is Walmart and PayPal. Walmart can basically substitute for groceries and a lot more, and both are rare categories to find. They essentially took a lot of spending from my 2X card and made it into 5X. Also the Chase offers are pretty amazing. Right now I have 20% flash discount offers from Shell, McDonald's, Best Buy, Dollar Tree, and Jimmy John's.\n\nIf I had to pick one system to reduce the annual fees I would keep the Chase trifecta and add the CCC and Amex BCP so I get at least 5% cash on major categories all year. I might do that. The 25% travel portal boost is very easy to use and useful for budget trips and holiday trips which usually don't have good awards deals.\n\nAnother good setup I heard of is VentureX, SavorOne, and every 5% card you can get. That would be one I'd pick for the frequent traveller.",

I assume you’d have to rely on alliances and partnerships to do that, especially for domestic flights? If that’s the case, I can definitely see the case for starting with a Citi trifecta when you’re focusing on cash back, and then adding a chase trifecta when you’re ready to try the travel rewards game. Lots of opportunity to mix and match cards to get the highest yield on all your purchases. And if you decide you don’t want to continue with travel rewards, just drop the chase trifecta and stick with your original Citi trifecta.How’s your experience been with booking through the chase portal?

It's impossible to find a good awards deal under those circumstances. That's when the Chase portal was useful. I got 1.25 cpp and the prices for the flights were the same everywhere I looked. Chase switched from Expedia to CX Loyalty which is the same provider as Citi so the experience is nearly identical now but Citi is going to switch to Booking.com by the end of the year, so Citi's portal might actually be better after that. There are trips where I had to book directly because the direct price was much better than the portal price. For instance, I booked an onsite Loews hotel at Universal Orlando for 3 nights and the portal price was over $100 more so I didn't even use the Citi hotel credit! Citi gives you 3X on hotels and flights whether or not you use the portal so it's better than Chase in that respect but Chase's 5X on Lyft can be quite useful too.In my circumstances I found the Chase travel portal with the 25% bonus to be more useful than I anticipated but I can see how the transfers would be better if I had time to plan it in advance or had flexibility. If I had Amex MR points I would be screwed. Those points are only for frequent travellers and those with flexibility and planning well in advance. I did book a hotel in Chicago on the Citi portal to get the $100 hotel credit. The prices were same everywhere because it was a chain hotel and they don't undercut the portals. I was disappointed that Citi's portal was down and I had to call them to book it. It seems to be down too often but I hope that improves when they change their provider.I've been a loyal Citi customer for over 20 years but my recent experience with Chase has pulled me over to their side. Their online and app tools are better (even though Citi is no slouch either) and while I thought Citi's credit lines were generous (11k and 16k) they are small compared to Chase (22k and 26k). So right now I like the CSP better than Premier but that could change.",

Also important to note I don't consider $500/mo a very high spend category when regarding the CCC. Some people burn that in a week, but hey 5% is the best in the game (pretty much). \n\nEven if traveling just once in a year, travel card(s) can very well make sense. It depends what your goals are I suppose. \n\nI've redeemed for a handful of trips this last year but on just 1 of them 4 AF travel cards all more than paid for themselves. Cash value of those points wouldn't of got the trip covered entirely, not even at motel 6. \n\nI'm not suggesting 4 travel cards, or even 1, for a single trip. But it can very well still make sense if thats your aim.",

And you can always PC or cancel a travel card after the trip if you don't think you will travel again for the foreseeable future.This post was (probably obviously) inspired by my own situation as I'm debating which card to go for next. I made the post more general than my situation so more people can relate to it in the future and modify to their situation as need be. I was struggling to find threads and youtube videos that discussed good setups for people who rarely fly and only fly economy. Cash back is good for that situation most of the time, but you can squeeze a little more value out with a travel card when needed.",

But that's gonna be undervalued long term if there's not some good UR earning going on with other cards. And CCC, for reasons you've described, will likely be a better setup for average/low spend and a cashback setup. I don't know enough about Citi Premier or their transfer partners domestic economy value to know how it would work out, but doesn't seem a popular choice if travel redemptions are the key. In my experience with Amex partner searches, 1cpp or less was what I would of got for domestic economy and I just paid cash instead. In regard to cheap domestic flights, Chase has SW option. Depending on the airports, it can be a great economy option. Good enough for me at least, and 1.4-1.6cpp redemption without having to use the portal for the \"boost\". Low rate especially if you check a bag or 2 usually, cancel up to 10mins before the flight, decent leg room, and consistent value.",

I'd never really used any of the card benefits like cell phone protection, warranty, price protection so the nerfed Citi benefits don't really mind with me.\n\nI'm purely cashback, never really take flights or stay in hotels since most of my travel is camping/hiking. Even when I fly or stay in hotels, usually go for cheapest/economy tickets or stay in hostels. \n\nI find that if you got BoA Platinum Honors, combining that with Citi probably gives you the best Cash Back setup there is. Citi + BoA Platinum Honors setup is my long-term goal with the ecosystem.\n\nCombining the BoA Platinum Honors with Customized Cash/Unlimited Cash, and having multiple Citi CC and Rewards+ would effectively have at least 5.25% - 5.5% for Gas, Groceries, Dining, Online Shopping, Home Improvement, Drugstores, then 2.625% for catch all everything else. Wholesale gets 3.5%. \n\nI think if a person is just dedicated for Cashback only, then having the Citi ecosystem with BoA along with Chase Freedom Flex probably gives the most flexibility. If they wanted more 5% coverage, getting US Bank Cash+ for other categories. Then again all of this applies back to your original standpoint if a person was interested in carrying multiple cards. \n\nWhile Citi is great on its own, combining Citi/BoA/US Bank would probably be the ones to go for as dedicated cash back.",

        "selftext": "TL;DR:After some good discussions in the comments, here are what seem to be the best options:* Citi: if you’re truly undecided at best about trying travel rewards in the future. Citi offers the best pure cash back setup compared to the major travel rewards card lenders.* Chase: if you’re more confident you will try travel rewards in the future but aren’t ready to jump into it immediately. The 1.25/1.5x boost to travel points (if you have a CSP/CSR) for redeeming points through the Chase travel portal is the best value you’ll likely get for economy flights. For first/business class flights, you have to check which transfer partners will work for you specific situation.* US Bank Altitude Reserve: a one card solution that provides at least 3% on almost all your purchases (if you can use mobile wallet) with a 1.5x boost when using the travel portal or Real-Time Rewards  for redeeming points. However, there are no transfer partners, so this card is likely only beneficial to budget travelers.Original post:For this discussion, let's consider the following (very general) scenario for some credit card user:* The user is fine with using multiple credit cards to maximize rewards (cash back/points/miles) from their typical daily spending, but doesn't want dozens of cards to manage. Let's limit the total number of active cards to ~5.* Most of the user's daily spending is broken down into 4 main categories: groceries, dining, gas, everything else.* The \"everything else\" category varies significantly each month in terms of more specific categories within it. Example: Target/Walmart/Costco, online shopping, department stores, travel. Some months will be higher in one sub-category but very low in that same sub-category another month.* The user does not fly or stay in hotels frequently: \\~1 flight/hotel stay per year on average, which includes years where they don't fly or stay in a hotel at all.* The user is mostly interested in maximizing cash back, but may one day decide to try the travel point/mile redemption method to get better value when they do need to travel.If this user were to only focus on cash back, the best plan is to mix and match cards from different lenders to maximize the cash back in each category. For example: Amex BCP for groceries (6%), PNC Cash Rewards for gas (4%), Citi Custom Cash for dining (5%), one of many 2% flat rate cards for everything else, and maybe Discover IT or Chase Freedom Flex for the rotating 5% categories.If the user decides to enter the travel redemption game, opening a travel rewards card can give great value from large SUB, large multipliers for travel purchases, and making points/miles more valuable compared to receiving cash back (e.g. redeeming Chase FF rewards for travel vs taking the cash back). The downside to this (mostly) cash back setup is that when the user does travel, they are not efficiently collecting points/miles within one ecosystem to cover most/all of the cost of the flight/hotel when redeeming the points/miles. Some may say, \"If you don't travel frequently and don't want to have dozens of cards active, just stick with cash back. It's good enough.\"But is there a better middle ground? I.e. having a cash back setup that's mostly within one ecosystem such that they get good (but not necessarily the best) cash back, but if they want to try going the travel point/mile redemption route in the future, it would be easy to convert their credit card setup into a good (but not necessarily the best) travel redemption setup?My vote is for the Citi ecosystem:* Custom Cash (5%) for the highest spending category among groceries, dining, gas* Double Cash (2%) for everything else* If the user wants to try the travel redemption method in the future, the Premier can be used for the other 2 categories not used on the Custom Cash (3x for those categories) and for redeeming Thank You Points from all 3 cards when the need to travel comes up.* Using the product change method of getting multiple Custom Cash cards can even provide all 3 of groceries, gas, dining with 5% cash back (or 5x TYP) every month. So that's 5%/5x on all 3 main spending categories, 2%/2x on everything else, and a travel card for redeeming travel points at a higher value than straight cash back whenever the need arises.* The user only has to initially manage 4 cash back cards, and they're all in the same ecosystem so that if they want to go the travel redemption route in the future, they can add one travel card to maximize travel points from daily spending.* If the user later decides they don't want to deal with travel redemptions anymore for whatever reason, the Premier can be PC'ed to another CC. Having 4 CC's and 1 DC is great for a purely cash back setup too!This setup doesn't give the absolute maximum in cash back, but the 3 main spending categories all earn 5% every month, and no purchase earns less than 2%. Citi TYP typically doesn't have the highest value in travel point/mile redemption, has less travel partners, and lacks a lot of luxury perks from Chase or Amex, but Citi TYP still would provide a better value than booking travel with straight cash back.The main advantage of the Citi setup is how good the cash back cards (CC and DC) are when the user isn't doing travel redemption. CC is guaranteed 5% in a high spending category (compared to Chase FF which changes the 5% category each quarter) and DC is 2% compared to 1.5% like Chase Freedom Unlimited or C1 Quicksilver. Plus, the PC method of obtaining multiple CC's is a huge advantage. While Chase/Amex/C1 may offer better redemption value for their points/miles, if the user isn't traveling regularly, then the extra cash back in the years they don't travel will help offset the lower redemption value of Citi TYP. Plus the Citi cash back setup provides better cash back before entering/after leaving the travel redemption game.One disadvantage is having to pay the $95 annual fee for the Citi Premier in years the user doesn't travel, especially if using multiple CC's such that they aren't even using the 3x multiplier from the Premier. However, a travel card in any ecosystem is going to come with the annual fee, and the Citi Premier is on the low end.If anyone would like to offer a counter argument for a different ecosystem being better as the \"cash back/travel rewards middle ground,\" I'd love to hear! I think this would be a very helpful discussion for many people! I don't have any experience in doing travel point/mile redemption in any ecosystem, so perhaps I'm undervaluing how much Chase or Amex points are worth vs Citi TYP. If you have any insight about this, let us know!",

The Premiere could be real great for a sign up bonus but then the Autograph with the Go could be better long term with no annual fee.",

Don't pretend that the currency conversion rate is the same thing as a foreign transaction fee, and don't pretend that Citi doesn't also have a spread on their currency conversion. All currency conversions have a spread and the difference between MC and Visa is miniscule. So it's disingenuous of you to say that these cards have FTFs when none of them do, including the Premiere and even the Premiere has an exchange spread like the other cards.Also every one of these banks will give you a PIN if you request one, I just googled them all to be sure. Not sure where you got the idea they wouldn't. Besides it being rare that you ever need a PIN other than a gas station pump.I've already used Capital One Venture X in Europe and it worked great and so did the Altitude Go. I never needed a PIN for either. So I can speak from experience for all but the WF card that they are not terrible for Europe and are in fact great.They are all great cards, in general and for foreign travel. It's also great you like the Citi Premier, it's a solid option, but I wonder why you would mischaracterize the other banks and their cards.",

You're talking about the divergence in exchange rate between Mastercard and Visa which has nothing at all to do with Capital One. The difference is between 0.1-0.7% and even then 30% of the time it's in favor of Visa. Every card you suggested also has an exchange rate with a spread, just as an ATM card would. Can you wuote the spread? Do you have real data to prove Capital One is phony? Are you going to say the Schwab ATM card is a phony no FTF card because there's a currency exchange spread on that too? In that case the Premier is phony too. Why can't you just be honest about what FTF actually is? My suggestions are great and earn the same or better cashback than the Premier depending on the category. I'm sorry Capital One hurt you, but the Venture X is a great card for Europe and so is the Altitude Go.",

So your calculation is the extreme of extreme and you still can't be honest about what you are discussing. You can't produce any evidence of the difference in exchange rate either. Where are you getting a 0.4% currency conversion fee for Citi Premier?Real world, you've got $1000 in expenses while traveling (in your example) about 0.4% difference in currency conversion rate 70% of the time, so average 0.28% (0.4 x 0.07). That's an average of $2.80 more on $1000 spent while traveling and doesn't account for the 30% of the time where the rate is better on Visa it just assumes they'd be equal.Even with your numbers $4000 x 0.7% isn't $280 it's $28 dollars and the worst of the worst case scenario.

I've seen Delta flights from east to west coast (*one*-way) for $699 in some cases. Yeah, I could technically afford to drop $700 on a flight, but if it costs me $150 with Spirit and I have flexibility with higher risk of late flights, I'll deal with the woes of the budget option.",

I know, for example, I wouldn't get approved for any new Chase card right now because of their 5/24 rule. But I have the Amazon and CFF cards already. One day I can churn one of their travel cards, but I'm not in a rush.One other thing is I can't grab the Spirit miles quite yet because I've opened too many BoA cards in the past 2 years. I think I should be able to open it next month if I want to, but I'll probably wait until 2023.And even if I suffer a short-term credit hit, I was able to fly from Phoenix to Philly (one-way) earlier this year for just 7.5k AA miles (I think I flew back for 15k Alaska Air miles).

I used this for only those categories. (I also buy small dollar amazon gift cards at the grocery store, so that I can get 6% back on Amazon as well. \\*this should be done sparingly though and in small amounts, as AMEX can shut you down if you do this too much\\*US bank altitude go: 4x points on dining, take out and delivery, $15 yearly streaming credit + 2x on streaming. I use this for restaurants and for streaming service.Wells Fargo Autograph: 3x on travel. I use this card for booking travel.Sofi Credit Card: 3 percent back on everything for the first year, 2 percent back on everything after that. I use this for anything that doesn't fall into another category and when abroad, and for cell phone insurance.While this pairing isn't the most valuable for people who regularly travel, spend a lot on hotels, etc, I think this is one of the best combos if your totally monthly spending is fairly low, most of your spending is centered around every day expenses, ie groceries, gas, meals out etc and if luxury travel is not something you have much interest or see much value in. And even then you're still getting 3x points on travel with this combo anyway, so not bad. This combo also is good for people who don't want to spend time selecting \"rotating categories\" etc, as all categories with these cards are fixed. The total cost for this combo is just 95, (only the cash preferred has a fee).What are your top card pairings now?",

Most of their cards, even some of the free ones, include an Extended Warranty benefit, so it’s even better for Apple purchases than the Apple Card for that reason. Adds an additional year of warranty to your purchases. Accidentally break your purchase in the first 90 days of ownership? They pay for repair/replacement!\n\nIf you truly don’t care about rewards and you don’t want an annual fee, my unusual opinion is that the Schwab Investor Card from American Express could be best. It has all the Purchase Protection and Extended Warranty benefits on a free cash-back card. The only hurdle is that you need a free checking account from Charles Schwab, but they’ll give you $101 in stocks as a reward for opening the checking account and **it makes every single ATM in the world free**. They reimburse ATM fees worldwide. Perhaps the best debit card, period.\n\nAnother interesting card from for someone coming from the Apple Card is the American Express Blue Cash Preferred. It’s interesting because you get 6% back on streaming services, including App Store and Apple Gift Cards. You can buy an Apple Store gift card, earn 6% back on it, and then turn right around and get a iPhone, Mac, or anything else that Apple sells. That’s twice the cash back of the Apple Card. The downside is that you don’t get Purchase Protection or Extended Warranty benefits when you buy with a gift card, but you haven’t been getting those benefits on Apple Card either.\n\n(As an aside, the Apple Card is pretty unique in the sense that it doesn’t integrate with most accounting/budgeting software. Nearly every other card integrates with no problem.)",

It works through iMessage, but I never get a reply until hours later when I send them a message. Several of their customer service reps have also just been insanely rude (just ignoring my questions and marking it as resolved when the issue was unresolved).I don't really care too much about points/rewards, but I'd like a credit card that doesn't have these issues.Is there any card that you'd recommend that has a great user experience?I'm looking for- good mobile app AND good website- good customer support- integrates well with apps like Mint or Personal CapitalCurrent cards:Apple Card, $8k  limit, Oct 2020FICO Score: 770Oldest account age: 7 yearsIncome: &gt; $300kAverage monthly spend and categories:Not sure but I spend ~4k a monthOpen to Business Cards: YesWhat's the purpose of your next card?

If you want to keep it in the Chase family, the CFU or CFF pair well with the CSP. At the very least you are getting 1.5X on the spend with the CFU as a catch all. The CFF can give you some great cash back on the 5% categories.\n\nKeep in mind, with Chase, whether its CB or points, you get it all in the form of points.\n\nI am very Amex heavy, but I have a couple of Chase cards the I use as well pretty regularly (CFU and Chase Amazon Visa)",

You can probably book through the travel portal, but they are not an AA transfer partner and that is where you get the best return on your points (You will however get the small bump with your Chase points when booking through the portal if you have CSP).If you are really wanted to make your cards work the best for AA, you should put your CSP in the sock drawer and lean hard into Citi. Something like the Citi Premier card (or that AAdvantage card he tried for)This is why I am so big on Amex and do very little spend elsewhere, we fly pretty much only Delta.Edit: If he was denied the Citi card for putting in the wrong information, you probably don't have to wait to re-apply, you can try their reconsideration line and explain the situation. They might give you an opportunity to send it in and approve him.",

Do you stay at the same hotel chains?Using CSP for hotels by booking through Chases travel portal will get you 10x with the CSP, and booking your flights with Citi for the 3x would be a good combo overall. Especially if you like to stay at Marriott, IHG, or Hyatt properties, Chase points transfer very well to them.However, I am a believer in earning towards your constant.If you stay at all sorts of different hotels but you know the one constant In your traveling is going to be flying American I would just use Citi for everything and rack up AA miles (you’ll still get 3x on hotels through Citi). AA miles are worth around 1.5 cents per. So even at 3x you’re getting a decent return.Even if there is some loss of value sometimes, you also get the convenience of having it all in one place.Play with them both and see what suits you better",

He was denied most likely due to that. We are going to wait 6 months to reapply. What card can we get in the meantime? I was thinking the Capital One Venture Rewards? The offer is great, I think it’s 75,000 miles after 4k spent. But also unsure because I don’t know what to split between each card to maximize points.

It also has a \"Go Back In Time\" (GBIT) function so if you wanted the purchase to go to a different card than it chose based on the rules you set, you can change the card (once per transaction). It also works with debit cards (including Visa). I have a referral link to skip the current waitlist. DM me if interested. Oh, it also gives you 1% back on all purchases (yep, on top of your credit card's rewards) for the first 6 months. It's been a life saver now that I've got so many credit cards. I don't have to think when cashing out, just use my Curve card and I'm good to go. Unless it's a Visa credit card, in which case I have to stick a label on it and carry it alongside my Curve.

This will allow you to increase your credit limit quickly which will lead to you being able to get more business credit when the time comes. Shoot for at least $5-10k limit before getting a business credit card.Once you get a credit card, make sure you pay in full every month! No late or missed payments.

I use Apple Pay for a vast majority of my in person transactions (and many transactions on my phone), so overall, I’m just able to earn a lot more points with AR than I can with the trifecta (3x on mobile wallet and travel purchases). I also like the fact that I can use real time mobile rewards at $.015 per point with AR. You can book directly with travel providers and earn travel loyalty points with AR redemptions, so that just increases its overall value. It’s also a Visa Infinite with excellent travel and purchase protections, primary rental car insurance, etc. I could keep going… It’s certainly not perfect and there are definitely areas where the trifecta shines (such as Hyatt redemptions), but it suits my needs overall.",

We will be staying in a combination of Hiltons and Hyatts 265 days a year (we have a winter home/investment property for the other 100)So instead we are also adding- Amex Delta Reserve in place of the Amex Delta Platinum- Chase Hyatt Business- Barclays AAdvantage Aviator - free checked bags with AA- Amex Green - we may not keep this one- Amex Marriott Business",

Visa is accepted much more than than Amex outside of the US, in general the benefits for Amex are more US-centric, and Priority Pass is usually sufficient outside the US. As for the Venture X, their insurance coverage in my opinion is not on par with the Platinum and the Reserve. For example, after getting food poisoning and needing to visit the emergency room while traveling through Panama…Chase’s emergency medical covered everything up to $2500 with only a $50 deductible. Finally Capital One is a bit finicky on who they approve for a Venture X, so there no guarantees with them.",

Adding a CIC would be a good move too, but the SUB requires $7500 spend in 3 months which is ... a reach for most middle class people. The Amex gold is also a great option if you are used to spending 20 in take out a month for the credits. Add a BBP to that too. Since I got out of cards in like 2020 and back into the recently, they've since added the citi trifecta  which would be a good set up too. I still lean towards Chase for a beginner since you have the portal points boost if you're iffy about transferring. C1 CX also seems like a great option too.\n\nTLDR; start with a Chase trifecta, we'll talk about other options once I actually know what you're spend looks like.\n\nAlso, for most people I'd recommend staying in 1-2 ecosystems unless you regularly will use partners that are common among all of them",

You could even pair with a Bonvoy Business to get 7% off on the room rates.\n\nWe tend to forget the Marriott has a bunch of airline transfer partners, so if you’re racking up a boatload of Marriott points, it’s not like you’re locked into Marriotts only for point redemption. United, Delta, American, Southwest, and many more are Marriott partners.\n\nWith the Bonvoy Brilliant card, you earn a total of 21 points per dollar at nearly all Marriott brands.  Nearly all transfers of 60,000 points are at a 12:5 ratio, so assuming you’re transferring to a partner whose points you value at 2¢ each (a good baseline for international business and first-class tickets), you’re getting back 17.5% all money spent at Marriott. That’s actually a lot better than you would get on a general travel card such as Chase Sapphire (6%). And if you redeem for Marriott hotels, it would be closer to 20% back.\n\nSo my suggestions are:\n\n-\tBonvoy Brilliant (get 21× points)\n-\t[optional] Bonvoy Business (save 7%)\n-\tA general travel/dining card such as Amex Green or Sapphire to put non-Marriott spend on. If you booked thru a portal or went with a non-Marriott brand, you would use this card instead of Brilliant, but hopefully with the 7% discount it wouldn’t be worthwhile to use a portal. If booking a Marriott through a portal, you would use this card for the portal, but present the Marriott Bonvoy Brilliant card at the front desk. I would use this card on all your other spend, as well. \n\nRack up those points, it’s gonna be great!",

Adding a second Marriott card earns you more than $1,000 in annual net value with your spend, but it looks like the Brilliant + Bevy combo would be better for your frequent stays than Business.We don't know much about your other spend, and honestly, I'm surprised to find that if you're okay targeting Marriott redemptions above all others and you spend less than $8k/year on non-Marriott travel, sticking with a Marriott-only setup is okay! But if you were to diversify by adding a third card for non-Marriott travel, I vote Chase Sapphire, because:* It’ll truly give you outsized value with Hyatt redemptions, and you can always transfer to Marriott for more value that you’d earn on Marriott cards.* Sapphire is more efficient with transfers to non-Marriott travel partners.* Pay Yourself Back at 1.25–1.5× is a painless redemption for ANY travel.* You get primary rental-car collision protection for free.However I'd still put non-category spend on Bonvoy Brilliant because of Amex's excellent purchase protections, travel protections, and even medical evacuation insurance with no cap. Plus, for your favorite redemption (Marriott), you earn 2× points on non-category spend as opposed to 1×.I had way too much free time today (in bed for some minor rest &amp; recovery). I'm very familiar with Hyatt and Hilton programs (I use them myself) but had not yet done research on the new Marriott cards. Here's a quick spreadsheet I put together to support the Bevy + Brilliant recommendation.I hope this is helpful, and I'm glad to learn that there's a good use for these new Marriott cards![https://i.imgur.com/2COnQbc.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/2COnQbc.jpg)Edit: Sign up for [Eat Around Town](https://eataroundtown.marriott.com) immediately!

It's nice to have more partner transfer options than just what Mariott has, and you wouldn't be tying up any points that are locked out of Mariott!The Reserve is a great card, but if you spend less than $6k on non-Marriott travel per year, you're paying more for the annual fee than you get in points. That said, some would happily pay the $250 just to get Priority Pass, improved purchase/travel protections, etc., but you'll have most of that from Brilliant. I feel best putting electronics and things that break on the Brilliant — it has the best protections and their claims process is a breeze. Brilliant even Cell Phone Protection if you pay your monthly wireless bill with the card. But if you do get Sapphire Reserve, sign up for Chase's Priority Pass instead of Amex's — it includes Priority Pass restaurants as well as lounges. If later down the road you have \"too many\" Marriott points or you want to build up some points optimized for non-Marriott travel, change your catch-all card to this Sapphire or, better yet, a Freedom Unlimited. A silly tip that might be over-optimizing:With this setup, you'll have three restaurant cards. Brilliant gets a $25/month dining credit. Brilliant and Sapphire both earn 3× back on restaurants. Bevy earns 4×, but there's a $15k spending cap shared with groceries. Since you’ll have only one grocery card (aside from Prime / Whole Foods), you could 1) First using Brilliant on at least $25 in restaurant spend to earn the credit, 2) Then switch to Sapphire Preferred for remaining restaurant spend that month. 3) When the year is getting close to an end and you're able to see you're not going to hit $15k of groceries on the Bevy, you could move some restaurant spend over to Bevy to earn that 4× in Marriott points.  (The Sapphire points are worth just as much transferred to Marriott, but they're worth more transferred to many other partners such as airlines and Hyatt.)  If that seems like too much, you could just distribute cards between wallets/P2 and use whichever restaurant card you brought with you. Less thinking involved there :)  Happy travels!",

CFU with the “extra 1.5% CB“ offer for first year, giving you a $200 SUB, 3% CB (technically points redeemed for CB or otherwise) and 0% intro APR if you want flexibility.  Comes out to $500;\n2. Venture X with a 75k point SUB and 2x points (so you’d end up with 95k points or \\~$950+ in value depending on how you redeem; use credits to more than offset the $395 AF)\n3. An Amex, like Amex Platinum, preferably with an elevated offer through their pre-approval tool (ex. 125k point SUB vs. 100k).  Not thrilled about 1x points but this would get you like $1,350 in value.  Pay close attention to all the included benefits / credits to see how they align with your spending (ex. Walmart+, digital entertainment, Uber, etc.) to see if they do enough to offset that crazy $695 AF.  And downgrade, get fee waived, or get a retention offer in 12 months.\n\nEdit: As another posted noted, “value” is variable based on redemption, straight cash back may be less than transferring to airline partners or direct travel spend.",

Freedom Flex\n\n-Assuming 2 stable quarters of gas and PayPal (both yet to come to this year).\n\n-$3,000/yr ($1,500 if you're skeptical about gas being a consistent category)\n\n\n3. Kroger card (any variant)\n\n-Up to $3000/yr using mobile wallet\n\n\n4. Citi Custom Cash\n\n-$500/mo meaning $6,000/yr\n\n\nSo in total even if you are being as skeptical as possible about the Discover It and Freedom Flex, you'll have the ability to spend up to $13,500 ($16,500 if optimistic) on gas per year while getting 5% back with no AFs.",

There are a few cards that have 5% on ride sharing, but most if not all of them have spending limits.\n\nToo bad you weren't here for the Cardless Celtics card before the nerf several months ago. That card was crazy with unlimited 7% back on ride sharing services. People who had the card before the nerf got to keep the reward structure grandfathered in as far as I heard. Now you have the US Bank Cash+ with 5% on up to $2000 spending per quarter, which you will blow through in no time. Citi Custom Cash is even worse at 5% but $500 limit per month. So both of these cards would not work out well for you unless you plan on getting multiples of each, which you can.\n\nMy advice would be to go for a card with unlimited spending like the Venmo Card or WF Autograph. Unlimited 3% cash back on ride sharing. Both cards have no AF and if you ever stop using it for ride sharing, you can use it for a different categories.",

Most of these services offer respectable discounts for paying annually. Hulu, for example, is $6.99/mo for ad-supported, or $69.99/year (essentially 2 months free). In order to trigger the monthly benefit from Amex, I'd need to pay (and be discounted) $83.88. With other companies offering similar deals (annual = 10 months charge), you're basically getting ~$200 of real value if you redeem that entire $240.If they would make it an annual benefit, it would be much better.***That aside, you're not wrong. I'm just nitpicking the way they handle that benefit. If you book your airline and have at least $200 in incidental fees (we have $240 in checked bags each time), you pay $200 or more for a hotel (booked through Amex' travel portal), and you max out that $240 credit (which I value at $200 due to the loss of annual discounts), you've just knocked off $600, bringing the remaining annual fee to $95.At that point, compare the remaining benefits, credits, and points earning to other $95 AF cards and see how it stacks up. For some, the Plat comes out ahead. For others, it won't. YMMV",

They'll type in 1000, you swipe your bby card and select the differed payment option.  Then the remaining amount will display on the pinpad, you can then use the same BBY card for the other 500. It sees it as a different transaction.  Wheen it asks for standard or interest free, select standard. You'll now have the 1000 on differed and 5% back on the 500. You only get points for the amount that you charge as standard(5%). I think 200 is the minimum to get the interest free options.

I also think most people have at least one streaming service, and with the revamp I think most people would find it at least appealing - HBO Max works well for adults, or if they want something for the family Disney+ is a no-brainer for most.Sure, they're probably not getting the card for that benefit. But when the annual fee is $695, it's easier to swallow when you're not just getting the lounges, but also Disney+ for the family all year, and if you travel a lot it'll pay for one of those Ubers to the airport that you can't expense, or that drink on board when you don't get the upgrade. If you travel less, then maybe it pays for that Uber home from the bar, and it pays for the bag fee for those two trips a year with enough left over to upgrade to that nicer seat near the front. Each of those little nice bonuses is a little dopamine hit that will make someone holding the Platinum feel like they're getting value out of it throughout the year, which makes them more likely to renew even if on paper the math doesn't really pencil out.",

I worked for $7.50/hr at a fast food place and they gave me $25k. \n\nAnd while most cards offered 1% cash back, or up to 1.5% via a tiered structure (OG Amex BC), Chase outdid them. It was 1% everyday and 3% on 2 categories. What they did was had a ton of categories, and whatever your two highest spend categories were, they got the 3% back for that month. \n\nOn top of that, you got a 25% bonus for redeeming at a higher level. So it was a 1.25%/3.75% card. I routinely averaged 2.5% or better because of how that categories shook out. They nerfed the shit out of it before turning it into what is now the Freedom Flex. \n\n***\n\nAnother popular one back in the day was the CITI Driver’s Edge.  I didn’t have it, but it’s rewards tiers were legendary for its time, especially the first year where you could earn uncapped 6% on its categories.",

Amazing points can be earned if you book travel through their travel portal, like 10x points on rental cars or 5x points on flights. Not to mention the travel portal is very user friendly and gives good prices comparable to Expedia. Plus lounge access, global entry/ precheck reimbursement, extraordinary customer services, and so many other perks.

Would like to get one that offers the most rewards, whether it’s cash back or travel benefits. We take one week-long trip a year, but I’ve never used any rewards for it and don’t know how it works, so the travel benefits would need to be easy to use. We prefer to fly Delta if that matters. My FICO 5,4,2 scores are 690, 712, 670. Annual income $45,000. Only one other CC- OpenSky with $200 limit, opened in April 22. I used it after cleaning up my credit report to get my credit going in the right direction. I’ve done consults with Color My Credit and now know how to use CCs to my benefit. (Pay down to 10% balance before statement closing date.) The next step in her class is getting an unsecured CC, but I just want to make sure I get one that’s worth it, has some benefits.

You have a biz, and you’d be a fool not to. Amongst others, you will want to try for AMEX Biz Plat 250K +10K/$30K SUB offer, Biz Gold 180K +10K offer (both call-in targeted offers), Chase Ink Premier and the new Capital One Spark (both require Biz Relationship Mgrs), etc. If you’re lucky, after your initial Biz Gold &amp; Plats, you will then get targeted for Biz Plat &amp; Gold NLL offers. \n\nYou’ll want to spread out the spend on the highest SUBs possible constrained by rules. Decide if you want cash back or which points currency and if any statuses by spend are desired.  \n\nTry to get checking acct SUBs for Citi, Chase, BOA, and USB. Open savings only if no ck SUB offers available. Deposit cash and use these relationships for better approval odds.\n \nRegardless, *after you have relationships there*, since you are 0/24, I’d VERY strongly recommend you start w/Citi Premier and then Altitude Reserve, if that means you are also currently 0/6 or 1/6 inqs. These are high SUBs, w/reasons to get, but also are amongst hardest to get because inq sensitive, which is why you start with them. Then look at other cards, especially the biz cards mentioned above. DO NOT get CSR or CSP until you research MDD.  DO NOT get to 5/24. You want INKs.",

If you get lucky you can get a $1000 signing bonus on a AMEX Business Platinum card.  I believe they  don't charge you for the first year, but should definitely verify that fact, Of course you need to charge a lot on the card and pay that each month,  rack up some more rewards along the way, depending on what you do with your reward points they can be quite valuable transferred the right partner, not a  AmEx reward points specialist and don't fly international where those points are more valuable.  You may walk away with a  $1500 plus an AmEx business platinum for the year.  Of course when your 1st year is up, you can call in ask them to wave the annual fee for another year, since you have been a good customer and spent over $300,000 on there card.   \n\n\nBut its not some huge sum that you can apply for a card, and go charge $3000 on.",

This way you can actually use your points towards the cheapest flight to begin with.\n\nIf you do decide to sign up, I’d appreciate you messaging me to use my referral link!

You don't need to spend a dime on that card other than your plane tickets to get the benefits. Other than that, I would only spend the minimum to get the sign up bonus. All other spending I put on the cashback card. Before the next annual fee comes up, I'd probably cancel the card unless I really needed the benefits from the card. \n\nI don't know how much leisure travel you do, but it's very expensive nowadays. You have to eat out every meal for the most part. You need hotel points or pay money for hotels out of town. I'm not rich enough to travel all the time unless I do the youth hostel thing all over again. I don't want to feel pressured to burn miles and spend real money on a vacation because I have too many miles lying around unused and subject to expiration. That is why putting almost all spending on cashback cards is better for me.",

Go pays 4% cashback on dining, with no AF. So on the one extreme, if you leverage MRs efficiently and make good use of the Gold's credits (*so as to absorb the cost of the AF*), you might derive far more value from the Gold than the Alt. Go. On the other extreme, if you're cashing out your MRs and not using the Gold's credits, then the Alt. Go comes out way ahead.The other consideration is AmEx acceptance outside the U.S. That remains somewhat spotty outside fine dining restaurants in major capitals. In contrast, the Alt. Go is a no foreign transaction fee Visa, so it's about as good as you can get as far as acceptance goes.I *never* recommend relying solely on AmEx when traveling abroad. I always recommend at least one no-FTF Visa and one no-FTF Mastercard (*or, at least, a card whose FTF is canceled out by its rewards - e.g., the Fidelity Visa has a 1% FTF but earns 2% cashback, so it effectively becomes a 1% cashback card abroad - not great, but still usable!*). The Alt. Go could fill the no-FTF Visa spot in your wallet.",

It is often paired with the American Express Gold Card, which earns 4× points on dining and groceries. These points can be transferred to a number of partners, including most international airline partners, where the value of redemptions is highest. \n\nIf you think you’ll travel with the same airline so often that you might be able to earn status, you might prefer to earn status rather than the most points possible. If you aren’t loyal to a specific airline, there’s no point in doing this. It’s pretty hard to earn airline status – you have to spend quite a bit.\n\nWe can’t really give a more detailed answer because there aren’t many details in your request. It would help to know how much you plan to spend on flights each year, and whether or not you prefer a certain  airline.\n\nHappy traveling!",

But I try to leave around 1% left, that way the statement reports a balance. Then once the statement is issued, I pay it off. I wouldn’t expect you need to restrict your spending. But maybe others will have a different opinion.  I agree with you, I am in a similar situation, but with one caveat (which can be dangerous if you aren’t careful). I do not have the need for any big spends which require credit at the moment, but I would still like to build it up for when I do. Then like you said, I only buy it, if I have the cash to pay it in full. The one exception where I go against this (sort of), is when I do a little churning. I do not buy multiple gift cards at once. I buy one, then use it. If I am able to max out the cash back in a quarter, cool. If I do not, then it is no biggie. One good thing about Discover is the cash back is matched in the first year.",

I could pay before 08/25, but if I reduce it to $0 then nothing gets reported and I have 0% utilization. As I understand it, I should pay it down to under 10% of my limit.

                "commentText": "The earlier date is your statement close date. Pay it off before that date.The later date is your payment due date. If you haven't paid things off entirely before your statement close date, *make sure* you make *at least* the minimum payment (which will be stated in your credit card phone app or on the website for your card) before that date so you don't get hit with a late payment on your credit report. And unless you have a 0% APR promotion you will be charged interest on any balance remaining after that date.&gt; As I understand it, I should pay it down to under 10% of my limit.This is something that is often called AZEO, which means \"all zero except one\". That is a way to shine up your score a little bit but is not at all necessary. For some reason with at least some of the current credit models, your score can be a bit higher if you have like 3% utilization instead of 0%, which doesn't really make a lot of sense but it is what it is. But it isn't needed. First, it isn't really going to be a huge boost. It isn't going to take a 650 score to 775 or something. It might get you like 8 points more or something. And second, while your score being a bit higher might look nice on a report, no lender just looks at your score and goes \"You're approved!\". They are judging things based on everything in your report considered together and you're not going to be denied for a card just because you have 5% utilization instead of 0%. You would have been denied or approved either way. And third, utilization doesn't have a memory, as people say. You could report 0% for 10 years straight, then report 4% one month and your score might go up a bit. So even if you personally feel the extra few points might make a difference in getting an approval, you only need to worry about it if you know you will be applying for credit in the near future, which you should pretty much always know as you don't really want to just be applying for credit randomly without some kind of plan. So if you do know, you can just make sure that you pay off all but $10 or whatever before you will be applying and your score will maybe go up a few points and look a little sexier before you apply. But again, lenders are judging your whole profile not just the one number and it isn't going to be the difference between getting approved or declined for a mortgage.Best practice is to use credit like cash like you said and make sure to stay on top of payments to not get charged interest or end up with late charges. If you want to pay off debt you can fully cover by splitting it into multiple payments to make a number that really doesn't even matter that much be a bit higher, that's up to you, but it is probably easier for most people to just pay the full amount every time, which could be anywhere from daily to monthly. And paying it off before the statement close date will make sure that you're reporting a utilization number that lenders like and not even risking having a balance that could result in interest and late fees if somehow it isn't paid off in full or the minimum payment isn't even made. It is easy to say \"I'll never let that happen.\" but life can have other plans at times and it is often best to do what you can to minimize risk in case something comes up.",

In other words, having a 0% utilization report would be the same as not using the card. I 100% agree it is more manageable to just pay it off in full before the statement close date. You’re also right, I shouldn’t fall into the trap of changing my life for an imaginary number. Cards are supposed to work for us, not the other way around.I was thinking interest didn’t hit until the statement due date. I thought the period between close and due date was a grace period. So using AZEO would actually cost me a bit in interest (pennies, but still). I will just pay it off before the statement close date as I have the ability to, and stressing about a few temporary points seems over complicated and unnecessary!Thanks for the great info",

So if the statement closes with a balance of $500 but you pay it off in full before the payment due date you won't be charged any interest. You should be able to google to verify that but I'm pretty sure that is the case.As for AZEO, no matter if it actually worth it I feel it is something that should only be thought about once people are comfortable and familiar with credit cards. I know it can be overwhelming at first so it is probably best to just focus on keeping things simple and developing good habits. Then once you have experience and understanding of how things work you can start looking into the more advanced stuff. Not that AZEO is that advanced, but it is an extra complication to keep in mind.So yeah just focus on developing healthy financial habits and you should be fine!",

First-class tickets (and points redemptions) with certain carriers often have flexible cancellation policies, so that could maybe take the place of Trip Cancellation Insurance, but that’s only one benefit.\n\nAmex will cover you IF you plan to travel round trip AND the points were earned via Amex or an airline. Even if the ticket you buy is one-way, you’d just need to have another ticket for return.\n\nIf you can’t meet those two requirements, Chase. Sometimes Chase business cards have requirements about the purpose of travel. (Their auto collision waiver doesn’t cover personal trips, for instance.) If this is a personal trip, I’d want to thoroughly read their terms to see if there are personal exclusions for any of their travel insurances.\n\nAlso, closing the cards technically is supposed to cancel coverage. Sometimes in the past, Amex has been lenient if you still have open a card with similar coverage, but I’d hate to rely on an unwritten policy exception like that.\n\nThe ideal card for this type of protection is the Chase Sapphire Reserve. Sapphire Preferred offers most protections too. With either card, pay for at least 1¢ of travel and get full coverage. No round trip requirement and no language about how the points were earned. Maybe it’s worth opening and holding a Sapphire card for this. \n\nPlatinum and other premium Amex cards (Aspire, Brilliant, Delta Reserve) come with Premium Global Assist medical evacuation insurance with no dollar amount cap and no requirement to even make a purchase with the card. A nice thing to have away from home, that hopefully you’ll never need. Chase’s medical evacuation insurance is a joke, it wouldn’t apply to most trips (including this one) and it’s ridiculous they even list it as a benefit.",

When I used the Capital One Petco it was 10% off up to $10 cash back or basically $100 spend and it was single use. So I got a little under $1.50 cash back and after two billing cycles a $9.57 statement credit so in total that equals 11.5% cash back.",

I am really new to using credit cards, but in the time I have had them, I have been paying them in full at the end of every month, roughly 700+ each time. I did receive a pre-approval from Capital One for I believe 2500, but I never applied for it. I am going to New Zealand from the United States on a working holiday for a year, I plan to have a job working part-time when I arrive. What are some good options for a credit card while I am there?I will be trying to live frugally during my time there, and save as much money as I can for mostly outdoor activities. I will be spending at least the first several months in hostels, so most of my money spent will probably be towards that, and rent if I decide to find a more long-term accommodation, as well as food and travel.",

Which card with no annual fee would offer the best travel rewards for someone that doesn't spend a ton on travel regularly? I don't care about lounges, upgrades, hotels or anything - just paying for base fares.Right now I'm thinking about the Discover it Miles card since its 1.5 miles/$ on anything (though it only matches for one year) and the Bank of America Travel Rewards, since its 1.5 points/$ on anything.Currently I use my Amex Blue Cash Everyday card for probably 90% of my purchases. I also use my Discover cash back according to the 5% calendar. So I want to make sure the travel card offers better rewards than getting the 1% back with Amex. Thank you!",

That's because my current utility company only accepts credit card payments through a third party provider, and they charge something over 3% (it might be 3.65 but I'm not sure). So for me it's direct debit. If your utility company lets you pay with a credit card for no surcharge you're already ahead of the game. That being said, I think the best option I've seen for utilities is the US Bank Cash+ at 5%. You can use a flat 2X points card like Venture/VentureX, Citi Double Cash, or Amex Blue Business Plus and earn points that way, but I think 5% cash is better. Of course, the US Bank Cash+ is a tough card to get and it's kind of specialized. I don't have much room for it with all my recent inquiries. If you're in the same predicament then flat 2X is probably what you have to settle for.",

Its SUB is only $30, vs. $200 with the Citi Custom Cash. Its $6,000/year cap is the same in total spend as the Citi Custom Cash's $500/billing cycle (month) cap (*though, granted, an annual cap offers somewhat more flexibility*). The only real reason to get the Sam's Club over the Citi Custom Cash is if one is already a Sam's Club ***Plus*** member, in which case the Sam's Club Mastercard pays 3% back on Sam's Club purchases.",

I'm also an onyx collector, so I use 40 percent less miles for the same flight.To put it into perspective, I used to be able to fly from Edmonton, Alberta, to Winnipeg MB for about 1800 points. Now I can do it for around 1000 points. If you decide to collect cash miles, 95 miles is 10 dollars for Im store purchases",

So does the Citi Costco Anywhere (*reqs. Costco membership; 4% cashback on Gas (including non-gasoline in-store gas station purchases), up to $7,000/year*).

I haven't needed to use many other charging networks though, so I am less clear on whether all the networks will code properly.I went to try it a few weeks ago on a non-brand L2 charger in a city garage and the charge never came through - so lucky me but I didn't get my answer.This has made me wonder if it would be the same on the Amex Green, since the Propel runs on the Amex network and therefore may use similar MCC's to decide what to trigger for \"broad travel.\"  I didn't have an EV when I had my Green so have no data points on that.&amp;#x200B;E: an update to paragraph 3 above :- tried again at this location with the Propel, the network is called EVGateway (which seems to be used around me by some parking garages with in-house chargers).  It does *not* code (unfortunately the WF portal doesn't seem to offer the ability to see the MCC like some others do).",

For just or mostly SUBs, check out the Amex Blue Cash Preferred and Wells Fargo Autograph.If you already have a Savor and Altitude Go, I probably wouldn't get a dining card given you already have two of the best.

We have both been Chase SR users for multiple years now and have separate finances and checking accounts. Both our annual fees are going to hit on 9/1 - I'm interested in having one of us switch to Amex Plat in order to be able to use shared perks from both cards. So ideally, we would downgrade in the next couple of days before the AF hits. 2. We have no debt and pay our cards in full every month. Our top financial priority right now is saving for a down payment on a home.3. That said, our main priorities are 1. begin putting shared expenses (bills, groceries, etc.) on one single card and 2. maximize our benefits on our individual cards. Right now we use Splitwise to keep track of shared expenses and really just aim to keep things even-ish month to month. But a shared card seems much easier and less transactional.4. I don't want to say I'm disinterested in churning, but I'm not sure it fits either of our personalities - I would rather have continuous steady perks vs. hustling for SUBs.&amp;#x200B;* Current cards: (list cards, limits, opening date)   * Chase Sapphire Reserve \\[me\\] ($13.5k limit, opened 2018)   * Chase Sapphire Reserve \\[her\\] ($23.5k limit, opened 2018)   * Chase Freedom ($17k limit, opened 2019)   * Amex Blue ($10.5k limit, opened 2018)   * Bank of America Travel Rewards ($3k, opened 2010)* FICO Score:   * 795 and 810* Oldest account age:   * 12 years* Chase 5/24 status:   * 0/24* Income:   * Combined income of $275k* Average monthly spend and categories:   * dining $1,000   * groceries: $400   * gas: $0   * travel: $500   * other: $500* Open to Business Cards:   * No* What's the purpose of your next card?   * I'm leaning toward cash back as the main incentive for a new shared card for the shared expenses, and utilizing individual CSR cards for travel.* Do you have any cards you've been looking at?   * I'm interested in having one of us downgrade their CSR to a non-fee Chase and opening an Amex Platinum in order to benefit from those perks as well. As mentioned above, would like to do this in the next few days before the AF hits our cards.* Are you OK with category spending or do you want a general spending card?   * Leaning toward general spending for the new joint card.",

I used the Shopkick affiliate link to Sam’s Club and I bought my Disney gift cards and was making at least 5% cashback on top of the ~3% discount that was given for the gift cards themselves from Sams or Bjs. Around Black Friday they are discounted even further and the affiliate link discount was even bigger. I mainly used my Bank of America cash rewards credit card with preferred rewards to buy the cards online to get the bonus from my credit card. We used our Disney gift cards to pay for everything from theme Park tickets, to parking, to food, to souvenirs. Overall it saved us about 10% on the trip. We made sure to use every last penny. I told my children that the gift cards were a bit like foreign currency – they’re only good in the parks and once you’re gone from the parks they’re basically worthless.",

I would PREFER a card with no annual fee, but that's not set in stone.Thanks!",

They have a 7X-8X (depending on the type of account you have) \"rideshare\" category, but it includes \"taxis\" as well. My guess is that there is a good chance of many limousine companies coding under \"rideshare\" here, but I have not seen any DPs to confirm. You may want to look for some. Additionally, Brex recently dumped a good number of their smaller clients, so it seems like their threshold for approval may be going up and you do need a substantial business (which it sounds like you have). Given how much of a better earner this setup could be, compared to other alternatives, it's worth at least researching.If going with Award travel, the next best option is probably the CIP. The Amex Green, Altitude Reserve, or CSR may also make sense, depending on your profile. If going for cashback, the WF Autograph. This is all assuming the companies you're using have coded themselves as taxi service/transportation.",

California has 131 locations and the 2nd highest is 35 locations in  Texas. With over half the states being in the single digits.So the distance to the nearest Costco may mean only stopping by 1-2 times a month. Which means your not filling up every week at Costco's. This distance also means that any 4% saved at Costco's can be wiped out by the gas that it took to get there.Finally, let's not forget that you can only get back your Costco rewards once a year. That they send you a certificate which you have to cash at a Costco's. While I don't redeem rewards monthly or quarterly  I would not want to be restricted to once a year.I have cards that give me 5% back on gas for different quarters.

The best route (in my opinion) would  be to get The Freedom Flex, then the Freedom Unlimited (3-6 months later). Both have easy to get signup bonus, $200 bonus for $500 spend in 3 months, and have no annual fee. Eventually you could go for either the Sapphire Preferred ($95 annual fee) or Sapphire Reserve ($550 annual fee). They have points redemption multipliers 25% and 50% respectively. If you travel twice a year then you could easily take advantage of the Reserve’s travel credits ($300 on ANY travel) and the 3x points back on any travel. ANY travel includes airlines,cruises, hotels, Airbnb, Trains, Taxis, Lyft/Uber, bridge/highways tolls and even parking counts as travel. The reserve also gets airports lounge access through Priority Pass. So even if the fee is $550 (really $250 after the travel credit and less after other credits) I think it’s worth it. And if it’s too high the CSP has good travel protections.",

I hate that I have to use them once in a while just so they don’t get close. It’s annoying. I mainly use CFU,CFF, CSR and Chase Ink Cash (Business) which works perfectly for me. I still want to get the Amex Platinum, because it provides access to other airport lounges.

Amex is a bit less widely accepted than MasterCard (which is what the SavorOne is) but all major grocery stores around me take it. \n\nCareful with Costco, not only are Wholesale Clubs often coded differently than grocery stores (so cards that advertise a % off on grocery won’t count at Wholesale Clubs or even big box stores like Walmart/Target), I believe Costco ONLY accepts Visa. If you have a Costco membership and shop there a lot, I have heard good things about their own Costco credit card.\n\nPs: Also be careful before applying. Some cards have similar names. Such a Capital One has a Savor card that has an annual fee where the Savor ONE does not have an annual fee. Same deal with Amex and the Blue Cash Everyday (no annual fee) and the Blue Cash Preferred (annual fee). Annual fee cards can make sense if you use them enough where the boosted rewards they offer outweigh the annual fee but I personally avoid annual fee cards because I don’t have to do a math equation to figure out if it makes sense for me or not.",

The most optimal but most work annoying way is to open up the highest sign up bonus cards with you and your P2 and put the spending on that, if you could split up payments, and pay this over time, you maybe could have 500K-1M points easy. \n\n[Here's a link for highest card sign up bonuses. If you want to see business cards make sure to check the box.](https://www.uscreditcardguide.com/best-credit-card-sign-up-bonus/?mobile=)\n\nIs the 150K purchase a lump sum? If so, business cards or AMEX Charge cards are probably going to be the only card where you can get a high enough credit limit to make the purchase. \n\nIf it isnt and you dont want the hassle of opening up many cards for the signup bonus, the alternative is the Capital One Venture X or the Chase Freedom Unlimited which will get you 2X and 1.5X points respectively back on your purchase. If you want to transfer your Freedom Unlimited points to airlines you will need to get the sapphire preferred which isn't so bad. You'll get a lot of miles which you can then transfer out. (300K!)",

Obviously both of you opening up the normal amex platnium along with the business platnium and spending only 6K on each personal and 15K on the business cards will get you 600K points alone. 150k sign up bonus on each. Then you could keep on going with other high bonuses you find, lol.Personal Amex gold has a 90K offer when you spend 4K and the Chase Ink Preferred and Chase Ink Premier BOTH have 100K points offer when you spend 15K and have much lower annual fees. Chase Ink Cash and Chase Ink unlimited also have 75K point bonuses with lower spending requirements and have ZERO annual fee. You see where this can go lol. It can add up to 1 million +. You can see all in the link I provided in my first response when you uncheck the \"hide business cards\" option. Also i didnt count the other versions of AMEX Platnium you could also get. You see how this adds up, and potentially pool the rewards points into the same airline loyalty program account. Unlike Chase, one of you would have to be an authorized user on the others account in order to combine into the same loyalty account.Obviously I don't think it's convenient to be doing this crazy amount of card openings, especially if you really want to maximize and go into business cards and the insanely high amex platnium bonuses come with high annual fees.But it's an option. Venture X can be much simpler with still a lot of miles. That spending will get you 300k with the Venture X and you could do a lot with that. I actually think it's a card to keep and is justified by the annual fee also.",

So I'm looking for suggestions for a good credit card in terms of getting a lot of cashback.

In my opinion, you would need to spend a ton on hotels or make use of the loungebuddy credit to make the green a keeper. However, the sub alone for the green would make it worthwhile for the 1st year at least though.Anyways If you get a corporate discount for the green top maybe it could work for you though.",

That is, besides February on a non Leap Year year. Going off of the numbers you provided here, the difference will be close to $200/year.Edit: you're looking at a about a 12% premium by using OMNY. You'll never get that back with credit card rewards unless you churn high value SUBs constantly.* Unlimited metro card - $127/month = $1,524/year* OMNY - $33/week = $1,720/year (calculating a year as 52 weeks and 1 day)The additional cost of OMNY is $196/year. However, there can be some savings if you do not utilize the full 12 rides per week. For example, if you're traveling away from NYC for a week, you're saving $33 for services you would have paid for with a monthly pass.Can you pay for the monthly pass with a credit card? This would give you the best of both worlds.",

Plus, most people have a combo of groceries and dining (especially in NYC), so with the Custom Cash you're limiting yourself to one of those categories while the Amex Gold you have a lot more optionality.

There's no requirement to use the card at the fare gate directly to get the cash back. That does mean carrying an additional card (unless you can have the OMNY card loaded into Apple/Google Pay) but that'd apply with using any card to refill the OMNY card.",

With the Custom Cash you get 5% back on local transit (so basically anything MTA related) and then with Rewards+ you get an extra 10% on those points. (So 5 points become 5.5 points). On a $2.75 subway ride, you get a minimum 16.5 cents value from the points.   \n\n\nA different setup would be the Chase Sapphire Reserve (which is what I currently use but will be switching soon). Basically, $2.75 subway ride gets you 3x points (so 9 points), but the minimum value with the CSR is 1.5x on every point (so 13.5 cents in value).   \n\n\nI think the clear winner is the Citi Custom Cash with Rewards+ card.",

But, for those of us who don't I thought it might be interesting to dig into what the best credit card to use (essentially just as a metrocard) to get max value out of using the new OMNY system where you pay for your first 12 rides and get the rest free for the rest of the week.so here is the question:what card should we be using exclusively to pay for NYCT via OMNYthat is $33.00 per week for a total of $132.00 in transit spend per billing cycle. any thoughts?",

Keep in mind that ANA adds fuel surcharges which get expensive with some partner airlines especially Lufthansa. You can also do stopovers on ANA, I think two stops... so JFK, to Milan then stop over in Rome or whatever for 88k. \n\n\nThere are some other options too, and you can research them. But all of them are available with American Express. I would stick with your Membership Rewards. \n\n\n\nEdit: I'm a west coast pal, but since you're from New York. You might also find deals booking NON British Airways business class on British Airways. Basically Iberia Airways business flights. I just did a one date search for May 2023 and found 98K for $300 round trip. You have the option to pay less points with more taxes and fees like 64K points for $850 in fees. Or 83K points with $600 in fees. Which is better than ANA charging you 1K in fees for 1K+.\n\nIn that case, go with British Airways. I'd make an loyalty account and search for some examples dates first that you want to fly out to. The British Airways chase card will give you 100k points which is a nice bonus. Any major credit with points will transfer out to British Airways.... so big bonuses look for Amex or chase cards. Citi Premier has 80K bonus. The best card for every day spending will be the Capital One Venture X with 2X miles on daily purchases.",

We live close to JFK and LaGuardia and in a pinch would be willing to fly out of Newark.  Typically I think we would either fly into FCO or Naples.  What airline do you guys recommend for their business/first class.  We flew Delta (in economy) last time and even that was nice but having the extra space would be amazing.

I've looked into all the major players (Hilton ASPIRE, Mariott Boundless, WoH etc.) but am so indecisive! the \"book 4 nights and get the 5th one free\" offer from Hilton is definitely appealing, but I know Mariott has the biggest presence. I have the option of \"pledging my loyalty\" to a specific hotel brand since I do all of the booking. Right now, I have 4 stays racked up with Hilton and 1 with Mariott (I am currently Mariott Silver, though.) Since I have a Southwest card right now, I'm probably going to look into traveling mostly within the United States/Hawaii/Caribbean.

It may not work for you because it involves Kroger as well and you may not have one.\n\nI buy giftcards at Kroger during their 4x gas promotions on giftcards (you need a kroger plus card) and the app and to clip the coupon in the app. You can get 35 gallons of fuel each time you use gas points. I buy so many giftcards i typically fill up my car and 4 gas cans for about $4 to $8. (It only does it in increments of .10 so you if gas is $2.89 a gallon and you have 3,500 points you can only use 2800 points so you'd pay .09 a gallon and you'd have 700 points left over. \n\nIf you spend $100 on a giftcard and get 4x points thats 400 points which = .40 off a gallon. If you buy your limit of 35 gallons thats .40 × 35 gallons = $14 in savings for ever $100 spent. \n\nI also am a Pro-Extra member so I get about .01 rewards for every dollar spent at home depot or .02 in rentals. \n\nI also use my Amex Gold card to buy the giftcards at Kroger because i get 4x points from groceries. This is technically not allowed but it has never been enforced on me for 2 years now. The limit is 4x points for up to 25k in spending at groceries. After 25k its just 1 point. \n\nSo for every dollar i spend i make back 20 cents. .14 in gas, .4 is amex gold points (which can be converted 1 for 1 for HD gift cards. .2 in rentals. \n\nTechnically your amex gold points can be worth double if you convert for miles for certain airlines but i haven't figured that out yet and Im not traveling much while im DIY'ing my airbnb. \n\nIf you have questions lmk.\n\nI just looked at some of your work on your page &amp; your resin work is awesome. Then I noticed you were in Nashville too! Im in Inglewood. So you can definitely do this because we have HD &amp; Kroger.",

Amex Blue Business Preferred is a good one to stack up points when you want to travel. If not, the Capital One Spark cards will give 1.5-2% cashback or the Chase Ink 1.5% card.",

Cards I have -  Chase ultimate freedom, BoA with category spending, Discover, and an Amazon card. Account age - oldest about 6 years old.

Why take discover at 2% dining/gas when you can get 3% in whatever you want (including gas or dining) + the 2% in groceries which I assume you spend on as a student. \n\nPlus it's more useful than discover in the long-term IMO. Even after opening higher tier credit cards, I still use the BoA regularly with the 3% set to online shopping. Discover's 5% rotating category card can be useful in the long term, but a category you know you spend regularly on at 3% is better than a 5% that's only used occasionally.",

Then you get 2x points back on the surface that would seem like it would only pay the service charge, but again you get a 1.25:1 redemption value so .5% “profit”. At the end of year one you get 10% of all points you earned as a bonus credit means the 80k points plus the 300k points give you another 38k points, and those points then get redeemed at 1.25:1 as well.\n\nI am less familiar with the venture x but essentially you are doing the same thing on their travel card. This would be more for getting a mostly free trip out of the deal rather than cashback.\n\nI am sure you could do the same with the Amex plat 150k mr points or the US Bank travel card as well.\n\nHere is the caveat on all these options can you get a limit high enough that this doesn’t turn into a chore where you have to pay 10-15 times and would that be worth saving less than 1% more?",

I have an 753 credit score (Equifax, TransUnion), Experian 733, $120k income, and have been approved for just the Bilt and the Fidelity cards (no other applications yet). My school is paying for meals and room and board, and I use free gift cards from my internships to pay for my pleasure spending (about $1k in gift cards per year). Any pointers would be appreciated, as I don't plan to spend on anything until I get out of school!",

They did say that the coverage is only for collision/theft (up to the value of the vehicle) not for liability. Regarding liability protection, that must be secured in another manner (e.g. purchased through the rental agency or on your personal insurance). They said they had not heard of enterprise, or anyone else, declining visa signiture as CDW. \n\nThe rep sent me a pdf containing info to provide to the rental agency for using them (visa) for cdw. That said, I would still have to use my insurance for liability.

If you have a local bank or a bank you have a long relationship with, even if it's a big bank, go into the bank and apply for one of their free cards.\n\nThere might be a way to game the score system a bit by targeting say an 800 score by a particular date, but the actual scoring algorithm is purposefully kept secret.  We know what goes into the score, but not exactly how it affects the number.  The general consensus is 2 applications per year after you get your first card, less is better in the short term, but more is better in the long term (and significantly worse in the short term).\n\nFor example if you apply for 20 cards on the same day, your score will take a hit for 2 years, and then recover completely.  If you got all 20 cards, you'd have a very robust report.  If you spread those 20 cards out over the course of 10 years, you'd have a lower average age of accounts (and thus a slightly lower credit score), but your score would never take a major hit.  While I can't give you 100% accurate numbers, my guess is that the difference is negligible.",

You can read [more about it here](https://www.koho.ca/credit-building/), but it’s essentially a service that opens a tiny line of credit for 6 months. You pay $7 a month for the service, which just means making sure there’s $7 available on your KOHO Prepaid Visa.

It can’t hurt their credit at all.  \n\r  \nI’m in Canada, and the cards I’d recommend are [listed here](https://creditcardgenius.ca/best-credit-cards/prepaid):  \n\r  \n\\- KOHO Premium Visa - earns cash back\r  \n\\- Stack Mastercard - low foreign exchange fees\r  \n\\- MogoCard - earn bits of Bitcoin with each purchase\r  \n\n\nI don’t have experience with prepaid cards in the USA, but there are a few [mentioned here](https://www.cardrates.com/advice/best-prepaid-debit-cards-for-teens-and-parents/) that look like they could be helpful for you. \n\n\r  \n\\- PayPal Prepaid Mastercard - linked to your PayPal account and earns cash back\r  \n\\- Bluebird American Express Prepaid Debit Account - free ATM access and roadside assistance",

Feel free to use a throwaway if the items are too personal, but also know that it would be pretty much impossible to identify you from the information in the template. \n\nOften the best travel cards are not the airline-specific cards; those cards are generally good for giving you benefits that would equate to the first or second level of status. Especially since you travel with multiple airlines, a more general travel card would be recommended. We need your spending info to determine which travel card might provide the best benefits, though. \n\nAlso note that you don’t want to cancel your existing student cards. In some cases you can “product change” them to a different card, but the histories on those cards are significant to your credit score/report.",
