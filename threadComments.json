Can someone correct me if I’m wrong?\n\n\n\n**this is assuming the Disney+ credit has no value to you. just using the pure rewards rates of the cards",

How much do you value the rewards (MR, UR, Miles, Points,  etc.)? Do you care for lounge access? \n\n**Assume you care about lounge access:**\n\nAmex Platinum: If you hate travel portals and you think you can make use of many of the credits to offset the annual fee, this is the card for you. \n\nCapital One Venture X: If you don't mind using travel portals, and you want to easily offset the entire fee of the card, this is the card for you. \n\nChase Sapphire Reserve: If you don't want to use a travel portal, this card gets 3x on all travel, and you don't have to use the portal to get the credit. Though, it is not possible to entirely offset the annual fee with permanent credits. \n\n**If you don't care about lounge access:**\n\nCiti Premier: This card does a lot for you, earning points in 3x points on the all of the main categorical spending. It's a solid option. \n\nChase Sapphire Preferred: For $95 this card comes with very worthwhile travel protections that may be of value to you. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUltimately, none of the cards you listed are \"bad\" credit cards, you just need to find what has the most value to you using either math in what earns more points, or best judgement on what you value.",
